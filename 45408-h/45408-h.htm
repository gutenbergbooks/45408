<h2>SIX O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord, evermore give us this bread.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and
he saw it and was glad.</span></p></blockquote>

<div class='drop-cap'>"WHY, you've found another verse about
bread!" said Grandma, then her eyes
grew thoughtful.</div>

<p>"Association is a queer thing, children; association
of ideas, I mean." (Some people might
think that Grandma Burton used large words in
talking to her grandchildren; but the fact was,
she did not try very hard to make her words little.
Not that she selected long ones; her language
was always simple; but words which they
would be likely to hear among cultured people,
or to see in their books, she aimed to use in talking
with them. If they did not understand a
word, they were always at liberty to ask its
meaning. The consequence was, they were quite
intelligent children, and the phrase, "association
of ideas," did not trouble the older ones in the
least. As for little Sarah she did not bother her
brains about it, yet awhile.)</p>

<p>"Now you wouldn't suppose," continued Grandma,
"that there was anything in that verse to
make me think of a large, old-fashioned farm-house
kitchen, with a wooden bowl on the table,
and a wooden spoon hanging over it, and old-fashioned
dishes arranged on the shelf above it,
and a woman in a straight dress, and neck handkerchief,
bending over the bread-bowl, and a
little girl with a high-necked apron on, standing
before an old-fashioned churn, moving the dasher
up and down, yet I see all those things as plainly
as though it was yesterday morning, instead of
sixty odd years ago."</p>

<p>"What makes it, Grandma? What happened?"
And Marion settled little Sarah more
comfortably on the hassock, and straightened
herself, ready to listen.</p>

<p>"Why, it is this association of ideas I was
speaking of; my memory of that verse about
bread is mixed in with all those scenes. I was
the little girl moving the dasher. You see it
was this way:</p>

<p>"Mother was very sick that spring, and father
had to take her to the city to be under the care
of a great doctor, and he had to stay with her;
so we children were scattered. I went to
spend a week with aunt Pat Worcester."</p>

<p>"What a horrid name for a woman!" said
Rollo.</p>

<p>"Oh! it was a nice name. <i>Patriot</i>, the whole
name was, but almost everybody called her aunt
Pat. She was a splendid woman. People all respected
her. She was my father's aunt and he had
lived with her a good deal when he was a boy and
loved her very much; he liked to have me stay
with her. That winter, or spring, it was, she
had a nephew living with her; a great red-headed
boy named Jeremiah, only we always
said Jerry. I didn't like him very well. He
was a smart, bright boy, and might have been
pleasant, only he was always teasing children
younger than himself, telling them things which
were not true, threatening to drown them, you
know, or bury them alive, or something of that
sort; things that he had no more notion of doing
than he had of flying; but they were too young
to know it, poor things, and he had that kind of
evil nature which seemed to be pleased with
making others uncomfortable. He didn't trouble
me much, because I kept close to aunt Pat; but
once in awhile he would wink his great eyes at
me, and tell me he was going to swallow me,
some day, when aunt Pat wasn't looking."</p>

<p>Grandma's children all laughed at this, and
Marion questioned: "Why, Grandma, you surely
didn't believe <i>that</i>, did you?"</p>

<p>"No, child; not exactly, of course; and yet
I couldn't help feeling kind of creepy all over,
when I was in danger of being left alone with
him, and I thought of his great mouth. It is my
opinion that little folks suffer from these things
more than older ones have any idea. I should
despise a boy who would descend to so mean a
trick as trying to tease one younger than himself."</p>

<p>Harold looked out of the window, steadily,
his cheeks a trifle red. The question was, did
Grandma know, or did she <i>not</i> know, that he
told little Bobby White the other day he was
going to tie him to the top of the great big flag
staff at the corner, and leave him swinging there
for a flag, because his dress was red, and his
collar was white, and his eyes were blue. But
Grandma didn't look at Harold.</p>

<p>"Aunt Pat was moulding bread in the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
wooden bowl, and I was moving the dasher up
and down very slowly, and watching her all the
while. I wanted to learn how to make bread,
and I asked a great many questions; but, after
all, the thought most in my mind, and which I
said nothing about, after a fashion which children
often have, was this very story about Jesus
feeding the five thousand people with five loaves
of bread. Only the day before, which had been
Sunday, aunt Pat had read this whole story to
Jerry and me, and talked it over. She was an excellent
hand to tell Bible stories, she made them
seem so real. She explained the size of the loaves,
and all about it. When I saw the great big ones
she was moulding, I thought they would have
fed a great many more than the little lad's; and
from that I went on, thinking out the story, and
the way those people followed Jesus the next
day, and asked for the bread which would keep
them from getting hungry again, without understanding
at all what they were asking for.
Aunt Pat said they prayed just as plenty of
people did nowadays; asked great big things
without thinking of them, or wanting them very
much. Just then Jerry came in, blowing his
fingers, and pretending to be very cold; it <i>was</i>
a rather sharp spring morning, and he had been
out at the woodpile. He said he wasn't so cold,
though, as he was hungry. Aunt Pat laughed,
and said she wondered if there was ever a boy
made wasn't hungry all the time; then she
looked at the clock, and found it was about the
time when she always gave Jerry a lunch; for
he had been up and at work since five in the
morning. Oh! he had his breakfast, of course,
a little after five, but aunt Pat always gave him
a piece in the middle of the forenoon. By this
time she had her loaves all nicely moulded, and
she went to the closet and cut him a thick slice
of the most excellent bread, and spread it with
butter that smelled like June roses. Jerry took
great bites of it with a satisfied air, smacking his
lips to show how good it was; it must have
brought some thought of the very story I was
thinking about, for suddenly he spoke out:
'Evermore give us this bread! I say so too!'
Then aunt Pat's eyes flashed. 'Jeremiah,' she
said, and her voice was very stern, 'you are
named after too good a man to be guilty of
making fun of Scripture in any such way. Repeating
a prayer, too, and not meaning it any
more than the heathen do, when they mumble
words to their little stone gods. I'm ashamed
of you!'</p>

<p>"Jerry looked a little abashed, and muttered
that he didn't mean any harm; but I remember
to this day, just how wrought up aunt Patriot
was about it; she told Jerry that boys who
commenced by turning sacred words to fit their
own notions, often ended by being profane,
wicked men. And that's just the way Jeremiah
Carter ended. I haven't thought of him for
many a day. But he grew up to be a bad
man."</p>

<p>"After all," said Rollo, after a few moments
of silence, "you don't think, Grandma, that
quoting that Bible verse made a bad man of
him?"</p>

<p>"N-o," said Grandma, speaking slowly, giving
her head a little doubtful shake the while,
"I wouldn't like to say that. Boys do trifle
with serious words, sometimes, and get over it,
and make good men. I should be sorry <i>enough</i>
if I thought they didn't. But then, Jeremiah
Carter was exactly that kind of a boy. He had
no reverence for the Bible, nor for words of
prayer; he was tempted to make fun of everything;
and he got so used to it, that after awhile,
nothing of that kind shocked him; he became
one of these men who pretend not to believe the
Bible; and sometimes I have thought that if he
had not learned to make light of it when he was
a boy, it would not have come so handy when
he grew up. Anyhow it always makes me
think of Jeremiah Carter when I hear anybody
doing it; and he isn't a pleasant body to think
of, I can tell you. He died a good many years
ago, and they said his last word was a profane
one."</p>

<p>The grandchildren made no other comments,
and Rollo presently began to whistle. He
knew one thing; and that was, it was a great
temptation to him to quote a Bible verse now
and then, for his own use. Not anything so
wicked as Jeremiah did, but in a way that his
grandmother, he knew, would call "light and
trifling." He wasn't sure whether anybody else
had noticed this habit and he made up his mind
while he whistled, that they should never again
have a chance to notice it in him.</p>

<h2>THOMAS AND CLARA.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THAT boy and girl in the picture were
real persons. They were Thomas and
Clara; were born in a certain town in
Steuben County, N. Y., ten years apart&mdash;though
they seem to be almost of the
same age&mdash;and always knew each other.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 352px;">
<img src="images/illus11.jpg" width="352" height="480" alt="girl sitting on footstool sewing boy with hat by dresser" />
<div class="caption">THOMAS AND CLARA.</div>
</div>

<p>Clara was a very thoughtful girl, and anxious
to know all about everything&mdash;often
trying to do things beyond her power. She
was also fond of her needle, and at an early
age could use it with remarkable skill and rapidity.</p>

<p>You need not be surprised to learn that her
father used tobacco. Most men do. They begin
in boyhood. Many boys think it fine to be
men, and that one of the quickest ways to be
men is to smoke
or chew. So
they become
deathly sick
learning to use
tobacco. It is
strange. It costs
a great sum of
money in one's
life&mdash;enough to
buy a home. It
makes the breath
offensive. It is
a very filthy
habit and selfish
as it is filthy, for
though the tobacco
user is a
great nuisance to
many people, especially
to ladies,
yet he does not
seem to care how
much others dislike
his smoke or
breath. He goes
right on puffing
his cigar or nasty
old pipe-fumes
into the nostrils
and eyes of all
who come near.</p>

<p>Now Clara's
father was no exception.
Sometimes
he would
come into the
kitchen or dining-room&mdash;the
parlor even&mdash;and
fill the air with tobacco odor.</p>

<p>Clara's mother would get out of patience at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
times and say it was a nasty habit and that men
had no more right to smoke and chew than
women.</p>

<p>And she was right!</p>

<p>Clara loved her father. In her eyes no man
was quite as grand as he except the minister.
But on this tobacco question she took strong
grounds with her mother, her pastor and Sabbath-school
teacher, who all thought the same
way.</p>

<p>Hearing her mother express her mind so often
against this "filthy weed" she learned the many
arguments against its use and resolved that she
would do everything in her power to prevent
her friends from raising or having anything to
do with it.</p>

<p>One thing she knew&mdash;she never, no, <i>never</i>
would marry a man who used tobacco.</p>

<p>Thomas was so much older than herself she
was afraid to speak to him as her heart often
moved her, about certain habits she feared he
was learning.</p>

<p>So the years went by. The great war of the
Rebellion came on. Young boys were joining
the army. Word came that Thomas had enlisted
and with many other young persons was
on his way to the front where men of the North
and South were shooting each other down by
the thousand.</p>

<p>Those were awful days. Not so much because
many died on the battlefield and suffered in
loathsome prisons, but because of the bad habits
many of the young soldiers acquired by being
among wicked associates.</p>

<p>Thomas passed through some dreadful experiences.
He does not like to speak of them
now, telling them only when he is urged.</p>

<p>He was in battle after battle and saw many of
his comrades shot down by his side. He was
also in prison.</p>

<p>But the war came to an end. He returned
and brought with him many things, among them
a great love for tobacco.</p>

<p>You need not wonder. Nearly all the soldiers
loved tobacco; the majority, I fear, played
cards and drank whiskey, and took God's name
in vain.</p>

<p>Thomas escaped everything except tobacco,
although he had seen so much of the other
things.</p>

<p>As the soldiers were brave for their country,
so many at home became bold for Jesus. Clara
came out on the Lord's side, though many of
her mates laughed at her for it.</p>

<p>But she stood firm and when she had a good
chance she spoke true words for her Master.</p>

<p>Between her home and another near by was a
telephone. Her cousin and Thomas would converse
over it. Sometimes Clara would "try
her hand" at talking over the wire. This, however,
Thomas did not know. He supposed
Clara's cousin, Halsey, was always at the other
end of the telephone, answering or asking questions.</p>

<p>One day as the conversation was going on,
Thomas said:</p>

<p>"Well, I must stop now and take a smoke."</p>

<p>"Don't do it," came a quick response. It was
from Clara, but Thomas did not know it.</p>

<p>"Why not?" inquired Thomas.</p>

<p>"It is nasty," flashed back the quick answer.</p>

<p>"When may I smoke?" came another question.</p>

<p>"Not till I give you permission," Clara replied.</p>

<p>These were her last words through the telephone
to Thomas. She never gave him permission,
as she died soon after.</p>

<p>Thomas never used tobacco after that. I heard
him tell the story in the meeting Clara used to
attend.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the air was ringing</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the birds were singing.</span><br />
When the sun threw westward<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long bright beams of gold,</span><br />
And the dew was sparkling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the wold.</span><br />
<br />
Found his plants all drooping<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sullenly and sadly;</span><br />
Buds and blossoms hung their heads,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Born to bloom so gladly.</span><br />
When the king demanded<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why in sorrow bent,</span><br />
There was but one answer&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Discontent.</span><br />
<br />
For the graceful willow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the fountain weeping,</span><br />
And the lovely jasmine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All her perfume keeping,</span><br />
Answered when he questioned&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each with envy spoke&mdash;</span><br />
"Ah, because I cannot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be an oak."</span><br />
<br />
E'en the elm-tree answered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sadly and complaining,</span><br />
"Ah, because I am not<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bloom and fruitage gaining."</span><br />
And the vine, down drooping,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lamentation made</span><br />
Just because it could not<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cast a shade.</span><br />

And the king said, wond'ring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the sight,</span><br />
<br />
"Wherefore, little Heart's-ease,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Art <i>thou</i> not repining?"</span><br />
And the Heart's-ease answered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All her gold heart shining,</span><br />
"Why, when me you planted<br />

<h2>"ONLY A CHILD'S PRATTLE."</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="72" height="95" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">IT was one of those summer mornings
when the earth seems all aglow with
sunshine. The Granger House faced
the east, and the doors and windows
were opened to let in the light and brightness of
the morning. It was a handsome house, somewhat
old-fashioned, but handsome still and
elegantly furnished. It should have been a
happy home, but there was a shadow resting
upon it; as yet it was not a deep, dark shadow,
indeed it was scarcely perceptible to any save
to one troubled heart. Mr. Granger did not
see it, he did not know that a horrible fear was
sometimes clutching at the heart of his almost
idolized wife. He did not suspect his own
peril and did not see as she did, the demon
lurking in those bottles and decanters on the
sideboard.</div>

<p>That morning, little Alice, the one petted
darling of the house, was playing upon the lawn,
with no other companion than her favorite doll,
almost as large as Alice herself.</p>

<p>She had wandered about the grounds, the
mother watching the golden head and thinking
that sunshine itself was not brighter, until suddenly
the child's attention was attracted by
what was to her an altogether new sight. A
young man was passing. Just in front of the
house he staggered and would have fallen had it
not been for the assistance of a companion a little
less helpless than himself. I need not describe
the scene. Unfortunately, to the most of
us it is not an unusual sight. We have seen too
often the unsteady and uncertain step of a
drunkard, we have too often heard the silly
laughter and listened to the imbecile chatter of
those who have drowned their manhood in a
glass of liquor.</p>

<p>But to Alice Granger, a child of five years, it
was a new and strange sight and one which she
could not comprehend. Her doll lay unheeded
upon the ground while with an earnest, curious
expression upon her face she watched the two
travellers out of sight. Then she ran to the
house.</p>

<p>"Mamma," she said, "there were two funny-acting
men went past just now. They went on
both sides of the street and did not act as if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
knew how to walk. They were just as silly
as could be."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; I saw them."</p>

<p>"Mamma, what made them act so?" inquired
the child.</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger was inclined to evade the question.
She was sorry that her darling had witnessed
the disgusting spectacle. She would have
spared her the knowledge of this form of sin
awhile longer, but it could not now be helped,
and as Alice persisted she said at length,</p>

<p>"My dear child, those young men had been
drinking too much wine."</p>

<p>"Too much wine! But, mamma, wine does
not make folks act like that!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it does."</p>

<p>"But papa drinks wine," and the little round
face wore a look of perplexity.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Granger did not reply, Alice said
again,</p>

<p>"Say, mamma, papa drinks wine. Does it
make him walk like that and talk so that nobody
can understand him? Say, mamma!"</p>

<p>What could the mother say? How should she
teach her darling to hate the wine cup and at
the same time preserve the child's respect and
love for her father?</p>

<p>"My darling," she said at length, "wine is a
dangerous thing. I will teach you all about it.
And papa thinks that a little does not hurt anybody;
but perhaps when you know more about
it, you and I can coax him not to drink any."</p>

<p>That day at dinner Alice astonished her father
by exclaiming suddenly,</p>

<p>"Papa, I wish you wouldn't drink any more
wine!"</p>

<p>Mr. Granger looked up in surprise, but he
laughed and asked,</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>The little face was very sober and the voice
very earnest as Alice replied, "Because it makes
men act so dis-gust-ing-ly!" The last word was
brought out slowly, as if it were too large for
her.</p>

<p>"What do you know about it?" The question
was addressed to Alice his daughter, but
Mr. Granger looked at his wife.</p>

<p>"Alice had her first temperance lesson to-day,"
replied Mrs. Granger, "and it has made
an impression."</p>

<p>"Seems to me you are beginning early to
teach her your peculiar views," said the gentleman,
half-laughing, half-sneering. At least, it
was as near a sneer as the gentleman in Mr.
Granger would allow.</p>

<p>"It so happens that I was not the teacher,"
responded his wife; "it was an object lesson.
She saw young Morgan and his friend pass."</p>

<p>"And, papa, they acted just awful! I wouldn't
have you act that way for anything."</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid. Fred Morgan drinks a
great deal and I only drink a little. That's the
difference."</p>

<p>Alice was still quite a time. Then, as her
father drained his glass, she asked suddenly,</p>

<p>"Papa, how much is a great deal of wine?"</p>

<p>"How much? O, I don't know," replied Mr.
Granger carelessly.</p>

<p>"I wish you <i>did know</i>." And now the voice
was very anxious.</p>

<p>"Why do you wish that?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you see you might make a mistake
and drink too much. But if I can find out
<i>I'll</i> keep watch and tell you, so you need not be
afraid of being like Fred Morgan."</p>

<p>Mr. Granger rose from the table laughing, and
betook himself to the library; but the last words
of his little golden-haired daughter had struck
home to his heart. He, Thomas Granger, like
Fred Morgan! Why, Fred was a reeling drunkard.
He, Thomas Granger, needing to be watched
by his little daughter, lest he make a mistake
and take too much wine! Could there be truth
in the suggestion? Was he in danger? Of
course not. It was a child's foolish prattle.
But foolish or not, the thought staid with him,
and, sneer as he might, it would not be put
down.</p>

<p>Was this the wise Heavenly Father's way of
answering that sad-hearted wife's prayer that
her husband might be brought to see his danger?</p>

<p>There was no wine served at dinner the next
day. The glittering decanters, and the bottles
with the age mark of which Mr. Granger had
been so proud, and the cutglass wine glasses had
all disappeared. No need now for Alice to
watch!</p>

<p>Her father had left forever the dangerous
path, and had resolved never again to lift the
wineglass to his lips.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="72" height="95" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">IT was a beautiful Sabbath afternoon; just
warm enough to make people feel still and
pleasant. The soft summer sunshine lay
smiling on all the world, and the soft
summer breeze rustled the leaves of the trees,
and stole gently in at open windows. In the
front room of the Deckers, the family was
gathered, all save Mr. Decker. He could be
heard in his bedroom stepping about occasionally,
and great was his wife's fear lest he was
preparing to go down town and put himself in
the place of temptation at his old lounging place.
Sunday could not be said to be a day of rest to
Mrs. Decker. It had been the day of her greatest
trials, so far. Norm was in his clean shirt
and collar, which had been done up again by
Nettie's careful hands and which shone beautifully.
He was also in his shirt sleeves; that the
mother was glad to see; <i>he</i> was not going out
just yet, anyway. Mrs. Decker had honored
the day with a clean calico dress, and had shyly
and with an almost shamefaced air, pinned into
it a little cambric ruffle which Nettie had presented
her, with the remark that it was just like
the one Mrs. Burt wore, and that Jerry said she
looked like Mrs. Burt a little, only he thought
she was the best-looking of the two. Mrs.
Decker had laughed, and then sighed; and said
it made dreadful little difference to her how she
looked. But the sigh meant that the days were
not so very far distant when Mr. Decker used
to tell her she was a handsome woman; and she
used to smile over it, and call him a foolish man
without any taste; but nevertheless used to like
it very much, and make herself look as well as
she could for his sake.</div>

<p>She hadn't done it lately, but whose fault was
that, she should like to know? However, she
pinned the ruffle in, and whether Mr. Decker
noticed it or not, she certainly looked wonderfully
better. Norm noticed it, but of course he
would not have said so for the world. Nettie
in her blue and white gingham which had been
washed and ironed since the flower party, and
which had faded a little and shrunken a little,
still looked neat and trim, and had the little girls
one on either side of her, telling them a story in
low tones; not so low but that the words floated
over to the window where Norm was pretending
not to listen: "And so," said the voice, "Daniel
let himself be put into a den of dreadful fierce
lions, rather than give up praying."</p>

<p>"Did they frow him in?" this question from
little Sate, horror in every letter of the words.</p>

<p>"Yes, they did; and shut the door tight."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have been," said fierce Susie;
"I would have bitten, and scratched and kicked
just awful!"</p>

<p>"Why didn't Daniel shut up the window just
as <i>tight</i>, and not let anybody know it when he
said his prayers?"</p>

<p>Oh little Sate! how many older and wiser
ones than you have tried to slip around conscience
corners in some such way.</p>

<p>"I don't know all the reasons," said Nettie,
after a thoughtful pause, "but I suppose one
was, because he wouldn't act in a way to make
people believe he had given up praying. He
wanted to show them that he meant to pray,
whether they forbade it or not."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Susie, sharply, "I want to know
how he felt when the lions bit him."</p>

<p>"They didn't bite him; God wouldn't let
them touch him. They crouched down and
kept as <i>still</i>, all night; and in the morning when
the king came to look, there was Daniel, safe!"</p>

<p>"Oh my!" said Sate, drawing a long, quivering
sigh of relief; "wasn't that just splendid!"</p>

<p>"How do you know it is true?" said skeptical
Susie, looking as though she was prepared not
to believe anything.</p>

<p>"I know it because God said it, Susie; he put
it in the Bible."</p>

<p>"I didn't ever hear Him say it," said Susie
with a frown. A laugh from Norm at that moment
gave Nettie her first knowledge of him as
a listener. Her cheeks grew red, and she would
have liked to slip away into a more quiet corner
but Sate was in haste to hear just what the king
said, and what Daniel said, and all about it, and
the story went on steadily, Daniel's character
for true bravery shining out all the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
strongly, perhaps, because Nettie suspected herself
of being a coward, and not liking Norm to
laugh at her Bible stories. As for Norm, he
knew he was a coward; he knew he had done in
his life dozens of things to make his mother
cry; not because he was so anxious to do them,
nor because he feared a den of lions if he refused,
but simply because some of the fellows
would laugh at him if he did.</p>

<p>That Sabbath day had been a memorable one
to the Decker family in some respects; at least
to part of it. Nettie had taken the little girls
with her to Sabbath-school, and then to church.
Mrs. Smith had given her a cordial invitation to
sit in their seat, but it was not a very large seat,
and when Job and his wife, and Sarah Ann and
Jerry were all there, as they were apt to be, there
was just room for Nettie without the little girls;
so she went with them to the seat directly under
the choir gallery where very few sat. It was
comfortable enough; she could see the minister
distinctly, and though she had to stretch out her
neck to see the choir, she could hear their sweet
voices; and surely that was enough. All went
smoothly until the sermon was concluded. Sate
sat quite still, and if she did not listen to the
sermon, listened to her own thoughts and
troubled no one.</p>

<p>But when the anthem began, Sate roused herself.
That wonderful voice which seemed to fill
every corner of the church! She knew the
voice; it belonged to her dear teacher. She
stretched out her little neck, and could catch a
glimpse of her, standing alone, the rest of the choir
sitting back, out of sight. And what was that
she was saying, over and over? "Come unto Me,
unto Me, unto Me"&mdash;the words were repeated
in the softest of cadences&mdash;"all ye who are
weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest."
Sate did not understand those words, certainly
her little feet were not weary, but there was a
sweetness about the word "rest" as it floated
out on the still air, which made her seem to want
to go, she knew not whither. Then came the
refrain: "Come unto Me, unto Me," swelling
and rolling until it filled all the aisles, and dying
away at last in the tenderest of pleading sounds.
Sate's heart beat fast, and the color came and
went on her baby face in a way which would have
startled Nettie had she not been too intent on her
own exquisite delight in the music, to remember
the motionless little girl at her left.</p>

<p>"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of Me,
learn of Me," called the sweet voice, and Sate,
understanding the last of it felt that she wanted
to learn, and of that One above all others. "For
I am meek and lowly of heart"&mdash;she did not
know what the words meant, but she was drawn,
drawn. Then, listening, breathless, half resolved,
came again that wondrous pleading, "Come
unto Me, unto Me, unto Me." Softly the little
feet slid down to the carpeted floor, softly they
stepped on the green and gray mosses which
gave back no sound; softly they moved down
the aisle as though they carried a spirit with
them, and when Nettie, hearing no sound, yet
turned suddenly as people will, to look after her
charge, little Sate was gone! Where? Nettie
did not know, could not conjecture. No sight
of her in the aisle, not under the seat, not in the
great church anywhere. The door was open
into the hall, and poor little tired Sate must
have slipped away into the sunshine outside.
Well, no harm could come to her there; she
would surely wait for them, or, failing in that,
the road home was direct enough, and nothing
to trouble her; but how strange in little Sate to
do it! If it had been Susie, resolute, independent
Susie always sufficient to herself and a little
more ready to do as she pleased than any other
way! But Susie sat up prim and dignified on
Nettie's right; not very conscious of the music,
and willing enough to have the service over, but
conscious that she had on her new shoes, and a
white dress, and a white bonnet, and looked very
well indeed. Meantime, little Sate was not out
in the sunshine. She had not thought of sunshine;
she had been called; it was not possible
for her sweet little heart to get away from the
feeling that Some one was calling her, and that
she wanted to go. What better was there to
do than follow the voice? So she followed it,
out into the hall, up the gallery stairs, still softly&mdash;the
new shoes made no sound on the carpet&mdash;through
the door which stood ajar, quite to
the singer's side, there slipped this quiet little
woman who had left her white bonnet by Nettie,
and stood with her golden head rippling with
the sunlight which fell upon it. There was a
rustle in the choir gallery, a soft stir over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
church, the sort of sound which people make
when they are moved by some deep feeling which
they hardly understand; there was a smile on
some faces, but it was the kind of smile which
might be given to a baby angel if it had strayed
away from heaven to look at something bright
down here. The tenor singer would have
drawn away the small form from the soloist, but
she put forth a protecting hand and circled the
child, and sang on, her voice taking sweeter tone,
if possible, and dying away in such tenderness
as made the smiles on some faces turn to tears,
and made the echo linger with them of that last
tremulous "Come unto Me."</p>

<p>But little Sate, when she reached the choir
gallery, saw something which startled her out of
her sweet resolute calm. Away on the side, up
there, where few people were, sat her own
father; and rolling down his cheeks were tears.
Sate had never seen her father cry before.
What was the matter? Had she been naughty,
and was it making him feel bad? She stole a
startled glance at the face of her teacher, whose
arm was still around her and had drawn her toward
the seat into which she dropped, when the
song was over. No, <i>her</i> face was quiet and
sweet; not grieved, as Sate was sure it would
be, if she had been naughty. Neither did the
people look cross at her; many of them had
bowed their heads in prayer, but some were sitting
erect, looking at her and smiling; surely
she had made no noise. Why should her
father cry? She looked at him; he had shaded
his face with his hand. Was he crying still?
Little Sate thought it over, all in a moment of
time, then suddenly she slipped away from the
encircling arm, moved softly across the intervening
space, into the side gallery, and was at her
father's side, with her small hand on his sleeve.
He stooped and took her in his arms, and the
tears were still in his eyes; but he kissed her,
and <i>kissed</i> her, as little Sate had never been
kissed before; she nestled in his arms and felt
safe and comforted.</p>

<p>The prayer was over, the benediction given,
and the worshipers moved down the aisles.
Sate rode comfortably in her father's arms, down
stairs, out into the hall, outside, in the sunshine,
waiting for Nettie and for her white sunbonnet.
Presently Nettie came, hurried, flushed, despite
her judgment, anxious as to where the bonnet-less
little girl could have vanished. "Why,
Sate," she began, but the rest of the sentence
died in astonished silence on her lips, for Sate
held her father's hand and looked content.</p>

<p>They walked home together, the father and his
youngest baby, saying nothing, for Sate was one
of those wise-eyed little children who have spells
of sweet silence come over them, and Nettie,
with Susie, walked behind, the elder sister speculating:
"Where did little Sate find father?
Did he pick her up on the street somewhere, and
would he be angry, and not let Nettie take her
to church any more? Or did he, passing, spy
her in the churchyard and come in for her?"</p>

<p>Nettie did not know, and Sate did not tell;
principally because she did not understand that
there was anything to tell. So while the people
in their homes talked and laughed about the
small white waif who had slipped into the choir,
the people in this home were entirely silent
about it, and the mother did not know that anything
strange had happened. It is true, Susie
began to inquire reprovingly, but was hushed by
Nettie's warning whisper; certainly Nettie was
gaining a wonderful control over the self-sufficient
Susie. The child respected her almost
enough to follow her lead unquestioningly, which
was a great deal for Susie to do.</p>

<p>So they sat together that sweet Sabbath afternoon,
Nettie telling her Bible stories, and wondering
how she should plan. What did Norm
intend to do a little later in the day? What
was there she could do to keep him from lounging
down street? Why was her father staying
so long in the choked-up bedroom? What was the
matter with her father these days, and how long
was anything going to last? Why did she feel,
someway, as though she stood on the very edge
of something which startled and almost frightened
her? Was it because she was afraid her
father would not let her take Sate and Susie to
church any more?</p>

<p>With all these thoughts floating through her
mind, it was rather hard to keep herself closely
confined to Daniel and his experiences. Suddenly
the bedroom door opened and her father
came out. Everybody glanced up, though perhaps
nobody could have told why. There was
a peculiar look on his face. Mrs. Decker noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
it and did not understand it, and felt her heart
beat in great thuds against the back of her chair.
Little Sate noticed it, and went over to him and
slipped her hand inside his. He sat down in the
state chair which Nettie and her mother had
both contrived to have left vacant, and took Sate
in his arms. This, of itself, was unusual, but after
that, there was silence, Sate nestling safely in
the protective arms and seeming satisfied with
all the world. Nettie felt her face flush, and her
bosom heave as if the tears were coming, but
she could not have told why she wanted to cry.
Norm seemed oppressed with the stillness, and
broke it by whistling softly; also he had a small
stick and was whittling; it was the only thing
lie could think of to do just now. It was too
early to go out; the boys would not be through
with their boarding-house dinners yet. Suddenly
Mr. Decker broke in on the almost silence.
"Hannah," he said, then he cleared his voice, and
was still again, "and you children," he added,
after a moment, "I've got something to tell you
if I knew how. Something that I guess you will
be glad to hear. I've turned over a new leaf at
last. I've turned it, off and on, in my mind a good
many times lately, though I don't know as any
of you knew it. I've been thinking about this
thing, well, as soon as Nannie there came home,
at least; but I haven't understood it very well,
and I s'pose I don't now; but I understand it
enough to have made up my mind; and that's
more than half the battle. The long and short
of it is, I have given myself to the Lord, or he
has got hold of me, somehow; it isn't much of
a gift, that's a fact, but the queer thing about it
is, he seems to think it worth taking. I told
him last night that if he would show a poor
stick like me how to do it, why, I'd do my part
without fail; and this morning he not only
showed the way plain enough, but he sent my
little girl to help me along."</p>

<p>The father's voice broke then, and a tear
trembled in his eye. Sate had held her little
head erect and looked steadily at him as soon as
he began to talk, wonder and interest, and some
sort of still excitement in her face as she listened.
At his first pause she broke forth:</p>

<p>"Did He mean you, papa, when He said
'Come unto Me'? Was He calling you, all the
time? and did you tell Him you would?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, bending and kissing the
earnest face, "He meant me, and He's been calling
me loud, this good while; but I never got
started till to-day. Now I'm going along with
Him the rest of the way."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," said little Sate, nestling contentedly
back, "I'm so glad, papa; I'm going
too."</p>

<h2>"BUT" AND "WILL."</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-f2.jpg" width="74" height="92" alt="F" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">FARMER SMITH was fond of birds.
When he was young, married and settled
in his new house, he planted trees about
his home for the birds to live in. He
made several pretty cages for the martins.
Here and there he put small boxes among the
tree-tops to draw certain birds that love to
occupy houses that other folks have built.</div>

<p>When boxes failed he would take old oyster
cans instead. One day he picked up a leaky
glue-pot and tied that on a young elm-tree.</p>

<div class="caption">THE HOME OF THE WREN FAMILY.</div>
</div>

<p>The next day it was "rented" by a wren.
There she continued year after year, taking a
vacation in the winter in Florida for her health's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
sake. She had a way of paying her rent that
quite satisfied Farmer Smith, as he never
ejected or annoyed her. He probably got his
rent in music.</p>

<p>As the years went by, the young elm grew
and grew till its top branches seemed almost to
touch the sky. It spread, some said, over a half
acre nearly.</p>

<p>The glue-pot, or wren's nest, had gone up too,
beyond the reach of bad boys that are not happy
in seeing birds happy.</p>

<p>One summer, when Mother Wren and Father
Wren had gone away on a short visit, the children
looked down from the door of their cottage
and saw some strangers approaching. Among
them was Farmer Smith. He was showing them
over the grounds and pointing out this thing and
that.</p>

<p>They came under the elm and talked, and the
young Wrens listened. And when the old
people returned they related the conversation of
Farmer Smith and the strangers.</p>

<p>They were greatly excited, as something was
said about cutting the "old elm" down.</p>

<p>But the parents quieted their troubled wrenlets
with a good supper and, putting them to
sleep, they talked the matter over in a whisper
with their heads close together.</p>

<p>The next day, charging the children to listen
carefully, they flew away, returning soon with a
good dinner.</p>

<p>As they sat eating, Miss Kittie Wren spoke
up:</p>

<p>"They came again, and I heard Farmer
Smith say that this tree was indeed in the way.
He could not raise anything about it, it shaded
everything so. 'But I can't bear,' he said&mdash;I
couldn't hear the rest. But I guess it was something
awful, and we'll have to get right out
of our pretty house or be cut down. O dear,
dear!"</p>

<p>And they all set up a cry, and were quieted
only when told there was no danger, because
Farmer Smith said "But."</p>

<p>The next day, on their return, Master Fred
related the talk.</p>

<p>"Farmer Smith said: 'I can't get through
winter, as I see, without cutting up "old elm"
for wood. But, dear me, how can I? I set
it out, and have enjoyed its shade so long. Yet
I suppose some day it must come down for firewood.'"</p>

<p>"No danger yet," said Mr. Wren. "So long as
that 'But' stands there he can't strike 'old elm'
one blow."</p>

<p>The next day Deb told how he came and
measured it and figured up how many cords of
wood it might make, and then he guessed he
might cut it next week.</p>

<p>"Needn't be disturbed, darling, so long as
Farmer Smith <i>guesses</i> he'll do it <i>next week</i>.
That does not mean anything."</p>

<p>At supper on the following evening, Fred
said: "Farmer Smith said to-day, 'Boys, I
want you to cut down the elm.' It's all up
with us now."</p>

<p>"Never fear a man who only <i>wants</i> a thing
done. Thousands of people <i>want</i> this and that,
but don't <i>do</i> it. You may rest another day,
children. Eat, drink and be merry till we get
back."</p>

<p>Mother Wren had barely entered the door
with a delicious dinner when Kittie, Fred and
Deb all put in at once:</p>

<p>"You had scarcely gone, when Farmer Smith
came out alone and walked around 'old elm'
muttering something. Then he said, 'I will go
now and get my axe and cut it down this very
day.' He is grinding his axe now; don't you
hear the grindstone?"</p>

<p>"He said, 'I <i>will?</i>' Are you sure it was not
guess or <i>think</i> I will?"</p>

<p>"We are positive," all said.</p>

<p>"Then pack up this very minute. We must
move before he strikes the first blow."</p>

<p>And away they went.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of folks who say they
<i>ought</i> to sign the Temperance Pledge; who
<i>guess</i> they will seek religion; who <i>think</i> they
will begin to pray some day, <i>but</i> not <i>now?</i> A
few <i>will</i>, like the Prodigal Son, and they are&mdash;saved!</p>

<p>Do you <i>but</i> or <i>guess</i> or <i>think</i> or <i>will?</i></p>

<h2>WHY SOME ROSES ARE RED.</h2>

<div class='center'><i>A Flower Legend.</i></div>

<div class='poem'><div class='drop-cap'>
ALL roses were white, in the long ago,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">According to flower lore;</span><br />
But one day an angel passed by that way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As a message of love he bore</span><br />
<br />
To a sorrowful soul bowed down by woe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And weary with ceaseless pain,</span><br />
And as he noticed the fragrant white flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He poised on the wing amain,</span><br />
<br />
And quickly approaching those roses sweet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A beautiful bud to pick,</span><br />
He whispered, "I'll take it with word of love<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I bear to the lonely sick."</span><br />
<br />
But as he plucked the beauteous flower,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose soft cheek was pale as death,</span><br />
He said, "As my errand this time brings life&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I will warm it with my breath."</span><br />
<br />
So he kissed the cheek of the fair white rose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which 'neath his thrilling touch blushed,</span><br />
And with message of love, and pink rose of hope,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sighs of the sick one he hushed.</span><br />
<br />
And ever since then, when a rose is red,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or blushes with delicate tint,</span><br />
A kiss, from some angel of love and life,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On its cheek has left its imprint.</span><br />

<h2>A MOTHER'S LOVE.</h2>

<div class="drop-cap">IN December, 1821, a man with his wife and
child were riding in a sleigh over the
mountains of Vermont. At last the horse refused
to proceed. The man set off to look for
help, but soon he perished in the cold. The
mother set off to look for him, with her baby in
her arms, but she was found dead near the sleigh,
next morning. The babe, however, was living,
for that mother had wrapped it in her shawl.
There is a sweet poem written about it. This
proves to you the deep love that wells up in the
mother's heart. Any mother would have done
the same for her child.</div>

<p>How earnestly should every child strive to
love and please his dear parents.</p>

<h2>WANTED&mdash;THE MOON.</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class="drop-cap">
THE Moon rose early, and Baby Ned<br />
Was rather late in going to bed.<br />
Not two years old, this dear little fellow,<br />
With head so round, and bright, and yellow,<br />
<br />
With his eyes so brown, and mouth so sweet,<br />
His fair little hands, and dainty feet&mdash;<br />
Wee feet, that have barely learned to walk&mdash;<br />
And his wise, quaint, broken, baby talk.<br />
<br />
He was perched that night on grandma's knee,<br />
The place where the small king loved to be.<br />
Where the wise brown eyes saw something new<br />
Through the window, up there in the blue.<br />
<br />
Over the top of the tallest hill,<br />
Round and silvery, fair, and still,<br />
God's grand old moon! that for ages past<br />
Has held its way in the night-sky vast.<br />
<br />
And Neddie wanted that shining ball<br />
To hold in his hands so soft and small,<br />
And nobody went and took it down.<br />
He wrinkled his face to a little frown;<br />
<br />
Red lips quivered&mdash;he wanted it soon;<br />
Then&mdash;<i>one more baby cried for the moon!</i><br />
But mamma brought him his milk and bread,<br />
And patted his dear little curly head.<br />
<br />
Then quickly he smiled and forgot the moon,<br />

O happy Neddie! so easy to smile;<br />
Your life will be glad, if all the while<br />
<br />
As the years go on you can turn away<br />
From all that you want when God says "Nay,"<br />
And laugh, and thank Him for what He may give&mdash;<br />
That is the way for His child to live.<br />
<br />
O manly boys, and sweet little girls!<br />
With all your colors of eyes and curls,<br />
If you would have life like a summer day,<br />
Be content with the things that are in your way.<br />
<br />
Seek ever the things that are pure and high,<br />
As planets that move in the evening sky,<br />
But if you can't have the shining moon,<br />
Be glad when God offers the silver spoon.<br />

<h2>WHERE I WENT, AND WHAT I SAW.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="72" height="95" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">IN the first place, I took a walk. It was
a March day, but I wore a sun hat and
carried a sun umbrella. Crossing the
road in front of my cottage, I went
through a little gate, ran down a hill under great
spreading pines, and walked along the shore of
a lovely lake, stopping now and then to pick
white violets, and whortleberry blossoms with
which to adorn my hat. Then I sat me down
in a rustic seat, and read a letter from some
friends in Ohio, telling about a snow storm, and
a wind storm, and a frost frolic, and I know not
what not of sulky, boisterous weather. Over my
head, meanwhile, the mocking birds sang merrily,
now pretending that they were robins, now bobolinks,
and now nothing but common chirping
birds!</div>

<p>Yes, I was in a different country; and you
are guessing rightly, that it was in sunny
Florida.</p>

<p>But it was time to go on; the great tabernacle
bell was ringing, and I wanted to be in at
the opening, for we were promised some curious
sights that day. After all, I was late; some
friends who had been in the woods stopped to
show me some pitcher plants, and to divide
great sprays of sweet-scented Southern jessamine
with me, and when I tiptoed into the tabernacle,
work had commenced.</p>

<p>Certainly the sight was curious enough.
Men and women, some of them gray-headed and
spectacled, each of them with a bit of paper in
hand about four inches square; red, or yellow,
or blue, or golden, as the case might be; all the
colors of the rainbow seemed to be there.
Each of these grave men and women were bent
over their papers, carefully folding, and creasing,
and re-folding, according to the direction of the
leader, until they had each made what a small
woman of six, sitting near me, called "a little
birdie with wings!" but what her gray-haired
aunt sitting beside her, pronounced to be a
"strictly correct geometrical figure." "Geometry,"
was that the subject? Well, that is for
grown people, surely. No, playing at boat and
bird building. Was that the subject? But that
is for <i>children</i>.</p>

<p>Well, you are both right; it <i>was</i> Geometry,
and it was <i>play</i>. And the name of it is Kindergarten.</p>

<p>Call it what you will, not a Blossom of you
but would have liked to be there, and help fold
that paper; and your mothers would have enjoyed
it, at least, almost as well. Why? Well,
principally because of the little dots at home,
which they saw they could delightfully entertain,
as well as teach, in this way; and because
of the tall boy, who yet is a trifle puzzled over
fractions. It would be so easy with those nice
sticks, which followed the papers, to show him
how to do it. Then the blocks, cunning little
squares, and triangles, and all sorts of shapes;
and what delightful things they would build, to
be sure! Do you know, I fancied I saw every
Blossom of mine, who has a sister or brother,
four, five, six years old, who must be entertained
very often by your puzzled selves, sitting in that
tabernacle, eager listeners and workers, getting
new and bright thoughts every minute as to how
you could combine pleasure with instruction;
and while little sister thought she was having
a "perfectly splendid time" in your care, she
would really be learning lessons which would
help her all her life.</p>

<p>Didn't I wish you were there! But since you
were not, and I couldn't reach to call you, why,
I will tell you about it now, and fill your hearts
with vain regrets.</p>

<p>Listen, my Blossoms. Kindergarten; that is
the name, remember. Is there one in the city
where you go, sometimes, to visit? By all
means take a morning or two, and visit it, and
run away with some pretty ideas to help you
amuse the little sisters. Or perhaps it is in the
very city where you live, but too far away for
the little sister or brother to attend; still, by
all means, go <i>you</i>, as a guest occasionally; and
my word for it, you will be richly repaid. Such
wonders can be done with bright paper, and
blocks, and a strong needle with bright-colored
silks.</p>

<p>Miss Ross was our teacher, in Florida, last
winter; and much did we enjoy the privilege of
hearing her. She is going to hold Normal Kindergarten
Conventions through the States, next
fall; look out for her name, and hear her if you
can.</p>

<p>Miss Matilda K. Ross of Chicago.</p>

<h2>A LETTER FROM FATHER.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="72" height="95" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">"I WONDER if we will get a letter from
father to-night."</div>

<p>It was Essie Carter who spoke. Her
mother sat by the window sewing, while
Gracie played with her dolls upon the doorstep.
Essie was just starting for the post-office.</p>

<p>"I think," she continued, "that I will go
across the pasture lot, it is more shady that way
and it is very warm this afternoon."</p>

<p>At mention of the pasture lot Gracie sprang up
and said in her lisping tones, "Gracie go too!"</p>

<p>"Gracie may go as far as the fence and wait
for Essie there," said her mother. And clinging
to her sister's hand, carrying her favorite
doll, the little one went down the lawn, across
the meadow and there cheerfully relinquished
her hold and set about hunting violets while
Essie went on to the country post-office, where
she secured the coveted letter. On her return
she found Gracie hanging upon the fence.</p>

<p>"Did you get a letter?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; and now we will hurry home and
mamma will read it to us."</p>

<p>"Did my papa write it?" asked the child.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; papa wrote it to us, maybe there
will be a little letter in it for Gracie."</p>

<p>"With what did he write it?"</p>

<p>"With a pen, of course."</p>

<p>"What is a pen?" asked the little questioner.</p>

<p>"O Gracie Carter! you can ask the most
questions of any child that ever was born, I do
believe!" exclaimed Essie.</p>

<p>"But what is a pen?" persisted Gracie.</p>

<p>"A pen is a thing to write with," replied
Essie despairing of evading the questions.</p>

<p>"Who made a pen?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," was Essie's frank reply.</p>

<p>And then she fell to thinking unheeding
Grade's questions. After the letter had been
read and talked over Essie said:</p>

<p>"Mamma, Gracie wanted to know who made
pens, and I couldn't tell her; a thing we use
so constantly too! I would like to know something
about them myself."</p>

<p>"Well, dear, can't you find out?"</p>

<p>"If we were at home I could study it up in
the library, but we haven't any books here excepting
poems and Bibles and the dictionary."</p>

<p>"Is that the way you rank your books?"
asked Mrs. Carter smiling.</p>

<p>"No; but it is such a matter of course to have
the Bible that I was not going to mention it,
then I just happened to think of the dictionary."</p>

<p>"Well, go to the dictionary and see what
you find there."</p>

<p>Essie turned over the pages and read, "An instrument
used for writing, formerly made of the
quill of a goose or other bird, but now also of
other materials, as gold and steel."</p>

<p>"Why, mamma, is that true, pens can be made
of a quill? I never heard of such a thing."</p>

<p>"There <i>are</i> a few things that my daughter has
never yet heard of."</p>

<p>"Now, mamma, you are laughing at me!
But truly I never heard of a pen being made of
a quill. Dear me, I wish I had a cyclopædia.
The next time we come out here I mean to bring
a whole set!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I could tell you something about
pens," said Mrs. Carter quietly.</p>

<p>"O mamma! I beg your pardon," exclaimed
Essie coloring slightly. "I ought to have known
that you could! I have heard papa call you a
walking cyclopædia."</p>

<p>"Your uncle Horace was at one time employed
in a gold pen manufactory and I learned
a great deal at that time, and we studied up the
history of pens. If I remember rightly the first
pens used were made of iron or steel and were
not used with ink, but the letters were cut in
stone, or clay, and afterwards the same sort of
an instrument was used to write upon waxed
tablets; then when parchment and paper began
to be used pens were made of reeds, and of
course the people must have had ink of some
sort. Now about quill pens. It was probably
more than a thousand years ago that some one
discovered that the quills of birds made better
pens for writing on paper than could be made
of reeds, and people have used quill pens more
or less ever since."</p>

<p>"Why do we not use them? Did you ever
use one?"</p>

<p>"Two questions at once! I'll answer the
last one first. Yes, I remember using quill pens
when I first began to go to school. My father
had never used any other and he had a prejudice
against steel pens, which had already come into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
use, and as we kept a flock of geese we always
had a supply of quills. It was considered in my
father's day one of the necessary qualifications
of a schoolteacher that he should be able to
make a good quill pen. Such steel pens as we
use may be classed among <i>modern inventions</i>.
It is said that they were first introduced about
the beginning of the nineteenth century, but
they were not a success and very little progress
was made in the manufacture for more than a
quarter of a century. One thing will surprise
you, I think. The first pens made, in an English
factory about the time they were successfully
introduced, sold for nearly twenty-five cents
apiece at wholesale rates."</p>

<p>"At that rate it would cost papa a fortune to
keep me in pens! Why, I use up a box in a
little while."</p>

<p>"Probably; you are apt to use up things."</p>

<p>"I wish papa would give me a gold pen; I
believe I could keep one a long time," said
Essie.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 546px;">
<img src="images/illus41.jpg" width="546" height="351" alt="LIttle girl climbed fence talking to person on the other side" />
<div class="caption">"DID YOU GET A LETTER?" SHE ASKED.</div>
</div>

<p>"Probably the best steel pens are made in
England, but American gold pens are the best.
A great amount of labor is bestowed upon them.
Every one is carefully tested before it is put into
the market. When a person buys a gold pen
he pays a good price for it and expects it to last
a long time, and this is the reason that they are
so carefully tested. If half the steel pens in
your box prove to be worthless, the remainder
are still cheap."</p>

<p>"But, mamma, you have not told me why
people do not use quill pens nowadays."</p>

<p>"I suppose principally because metal pens are
more durable. Quill pens require to be mended
often and one who writes much would find it
quite a task to make and mend his pens. I
should not wonder if we would find a bunch of
quills hanging from the rafters in the attic of
this old house and I should like to make a quill
pen for you that you may write with a pen like
the one your grandfather always used. And
now, Essie, if you will pay attention to your
father's request you shall have a gold pen when
we go back home," said mamma, smiling kindly.</p>

<p>"You mean about taking pains with my
writing?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I have sometimes thought that in
nothing does culture or want of culture show
itself more than in a person's penmanship."</p>

<h2>THE FOX FAMILY.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i2.jpg" width="70" height="117" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">IN 1840 there lived a man in Kinderhook,
N. Y., who was a smart politician
and his party often put him up for office;
somehow he had a way often of being
elected, as many popular men do nowadays.
He was nominated for the Presidency.
Can you guess his name? There was great excitement
on both sides. The Whigs had put up
General Harrison for their candidate and were
singing songs about Log Cabins and Hard Cider,
because General Harrison lived in one and drank
the other. They said many things against the
Kinderhook man. Parties always do say hard
things against their opponents.</div>

<p>Among other hard names they called him a
"Little Fox," and no doubt some voted against
him, thinking if he was anything like a fox he
was not fit to be President of the United States.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 557px;">
<img src="images/illus46.jpg" width="557" height="443" alt="mther fox and four kits" />
<div class="caption">A FAMILY OF FOXES.</div>
</div>

<p>People are prejudiced against this animal because
he is so sly and tricky.</p>

<p>Queer stories are told about his smartness.</p>

<p>He loves (to eat) fowl. He will swim toward
a duck <i>e. g.</i> with turf in the mouth, so as
to be concealed, then, being near, the unsuspecting
duck is "nabbed" for Mr. Fox's dinner.</p>

<p>He goes limping with his head down, as if
eating clover, till near enough to seize a hare.
When caught stealing hens, he will pretend to
be dead, though kicked roughly about, till he
gets a chance to "up and off." When traps are
arranged around his hole, he will stay in for days,
hungry, or make a new outlet rather than expose
himself to a trap. He knows how to fire off a
gun that has been set for him without being hit.</p>

<p>In Northern climes he can pull up the fish-line
that has been placed by the fisherman over
night through a hole in the ice. The man comes
early to get a morning fish breakfast but only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
find an empty hook lying near the hole and Mr.
Fox galloping off in the distance with the game.</p>

<p>The above is what "They say." Many more
strange things are said about the Fox family.</p>

<p>Certain it is they are a shrewd set, smarter in
providing delicious repasts for their children
than many of their neighbors, the farmers, who
treat them as thieves.</p>

<p>The Whigs did almost or quite call the Kinderhook
man a sly thief. They probably <i>now</i>
think he was as honest, perhaps more suited to
the Presidency than was Gen. Harrison. Very
different from the "Fox" of Kinderhook was
Charles James Fox of England who died a hundred
years ago. Strangely enough he was a great
Whig, though Whig in England was not the
same as Whig in the United States. He was a
fine scholar and high statesman; some say, "the
greatest debater the world ever saw."</p>

<p>Different still was George Fox of England
who died two hundred years ago&mdash;one of the
purest, best men that ever lived. The Quakers
or Friends started from him. He went everywhere
preaching the simple teaching of the Bible
and against trusting to forms and ceremonies.
Enemies arose against him and had him put in
loathsome dungeons. But he came out of the
prison (though not just as Saint Peter did, by
the help of an angel) but only to forgive his
cruel persecutors and go right on preaching
God's free and simple grace.</p>

<p>John Foxe was another grand man. He wrote
"Foxe's Book of Martyrs." Have you ever read
it? He died three hundred years ago. Thus you
see the Foxes are not all so sly and tricky as those
in the picture "look to be." See what queer eyes
they have. Somewhat upside down.</p>

<h2>SOME REMARKABLE WOMEN.</h2>

<h3>N.&mdash;NEWELL, HARRIET ATWOOD.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-u.jpg" width="71" height="89" alt="U" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">UPON the platform in Tremont Temple,
Boston, at the meeting of the American
Board of Commissioners for Foreign
Missions, last October, there was placed
a little mahogany table, old-fashioned in form
and dark with age. It was an object of great
interest from the fact that around that small
table, three feet by two&mdash;or, when the leaves
were spread, three by five&mdash;there sat, seventy-five
years ago, the five men who formed the
American Board at that date. The first meeting
held in the parlor of the little parsonage in
Farmington, Ct., was a small beginning, and who
could have guessed that Tremont Temple, Music
Hall, and one or two churches would have been
filled to overflowing by the crowds that would
come to the seventy-fifth anniversary! We who
live in this missionary age cannot realize the
weight of that undertaking, nor can we who are
saying farewell to friends and acquaintances who
go out in fast-sailing steam ships with many a
comfort and convenience unknown in those days,
and in comparative safety, realize what it meant
to those five young men and their wives who
were the first sent out by the newly-formed
board, to bid adieu to home and friends with
scarce a hope of ever returning to their native
land. Rev. Samuel J. Newell was one of the
five, and the subject of this sketch was his devoted
young wife. Harriet Newell was the first
woman who went out to India as a missionary.
She was scarcely beyond girlhood, only eighteen
years old when she said good-by to her widowed
mother and went out to tell the people of India
about the Friend who waited to receive them.</div>

<p>Mrs. Newell's early home was at Haverhill,
Mass. She was educated at Bradford Academy.
It was while she was at school that she determined
to consecrate her life to the service of
Christ, though I do not gather from any account
of her life that she had at that time any thoughts
of becoming a missionary. Her letters written
at that early period evince a rare thoughtfulness
and uncommon maturity of mind. Indeed, it
would seem that she early put away childish
things. Neither have we any account of her having
any of the good times of girlhood; yet I
suppose she was not altogether unlike other
girls, but we have only the story of her inner
life. She has told us in her journal of her conflicts
with sin and of her victories; we can see
the rapid development of her Christian character,
from the time she first engaged in the service of
God to the hour when she "consecrated herself
to the establishment of the kingdom of Christ in
Pagan lands. To this great and glorious object
all her thoughts and studies, her desires and
prayers tended. It was only with a view to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
this that she considered her talents and acquirements
of any special importance."</p>

<p>Mrs. Newell exhibited in her short life great
force and decision of character. When, after
earnest deliberation, mingled with prayer for
wisdom, the question of duty had been settled,
she moved forward without hesitation. Let me
give you the words of one who knew her well:</p>

<p>"The character of Mrs. Newell had an excellence
above the reach of mere human nature;
behold her, united to friends and country by a
thousand ties, a woman of refined education,
with delightful prospects in her own country,
resigning all for a distant Pagan land; all these
sacrifices she made calmly, with a sober deliberation,
with steady, unyielding firmness, and
this not for wealth, or fame, or any earthly object,
but to make known among the heathen the
unsearchable riches of Christ."</p>

<p>And now what will you say when I tell you
that this remarkable woman, remarkable for her
talents, her personal gifts, remarkable for her
Christian development, was to meet with disappointment
at the outset and was to be denied
the privilege of engaging in the work for which
she had left home and friends. They were
ordered away from India by the government and
decided to attempt to establish a mission upon
the Isle of France. Nearly a year from the
time of leaving America they reached this place,
having spent nearly all that time on ship-board.
It would seem that now their troubles
might be at an end; and so Mrs. Newell's were.
For in about three weeks after they landed she
was called to go to her mansion above. At nineteen
her work was finished&mdash;finished, as it
seemed, before it was fairly begun! Yet her
example of devotion, of fortitude, of love for the
cause, her submission and patience under trial
may have accomplished far more than she living
could have done. When the news of her triumphant
death came to America, other noble-hearted,
earnest women were found ready to take
the place of this first woman of our land who was
ready to give her life to the people of India. To-day,
after seventy-five years, scores are in the
field, more waiting to be sent, and I know not
how many among the <span class="smcap">Pansy</span> readers getting
ready for the Master's work in foreign lands. God
grant that there may be many such!</p>

<h2>OUR ALPHABET OF GREAT MEN.</h2>

<h3>Q.&mdash;QUINCY, JOSIAH.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-c.jpg" width="70" height="86" alt="C" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">COUNTING back for five generations,
we find in the Quincy family a Josiah.
The great-great-grandfather of the present
Josiah Quincy was a merchant, and
we are told that he was a zealous patriot in Revolutionary
times, and you all know that meant
a great deal.</div>

<p>His son, who was called Josiah Junior, became
a celebrated lawyer, and was prominent as
an advocate of liberty. It was he who with
Samuel Adams addressed the people when the
British ships anchored in Boston Harbor with
the cargo of tea. But notwithstanding his reputation
for patriotism, his action in defending the
soldiers who fired upon the mob in what is known
as the Boston Massacre, brought him into unpopularity.</p>

<p>Yet I think that if you study the facts carefully,
and weigh them well, you will see that
although the presence of the British soldiers was
an outrage, and justly obnoxious to the people,
yet upon that occasion there was some excuse
for their action. And John Adams and Josiah
Quincy should not be condemned for undertaking
their defence.</p>

<p>Afterwards both did good service in the interest
of Colonial Independence. Quincy went
to England doing much to promote the good of
his country.</p>

<p>He died upon the homeward voyage in
1775, in sight of American shores. His son
Josiah, three years old at the time of his
father's death, was educated at Harvard University,
became a lawyer, a member of Congress,
and having filled acceptably various other offices,
was at length elected President of Harvard, which
position he held for fifteen years, He had a son
Josiah, also a graduate of Harvard, and again
the fifth Josiah in the line is a graduate of the
same institution.</p>

<p>There are other Quincys of this family who
have attained celebrity. I might tell you of
Edmund Quincy, who was prominent in anti-slavery
circles, but I think you will find plenty
of occupation for this month if you study up all
these Josiahs.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="55" height="112" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">A BOY, breathless from long running,
rushed into Mrs. Allen's arms as she
turned away from the sitting-room window
with a sigh.</div>

<p>"Why, here you are!" she exclaimed
in a joyous burst.</p>

<p>"The fellows are in some sort of a scrape,"
gasped the boy, careful of his words; "can't
get home&mdash;I'm going to tell their mothers&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen looked at her empty arms, turned
and went out to the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Ann, you may put on the tea; we will not
wait for George Edward."</p>

<p>"Land! he just raced in, red as a boiled
lobster," cried Ann with the privilege of a
favored servant.</p>

<p>"I know; but he is off again, on an errand
that had to be attended to&mdash;put on the tea,
and ring the bell."</p>

<p>It was some time before the son of the family
made his appearance in the Allen household
again. When he did come, it was to bring a
face so utterly miserable, and a pair of feet so
incapacitated for further movement, that his
mother began to seriously question if she had
done the wise thing to allow him to be the deliverer
of the several messages.</p>

<p>The first thing to do now, however, was to
get the boy to bed; so with the aid of Ann's
hot oatmeal gruel, George Edward was assisted
by father and mother on either side, up to his
pretty room, where he was rubbed down, pretty
much as one would perform that same operation
on a tired horse, till each separate and distinct
joint seemed supple and elastic as was their
ordinary condition, and the boy was tumbled
into bed, fast asleep before his head touched
the pillow. Mr. and Mrs. Allen looked at each
other as they sat down in the library, and drew
a long breath.</p>

<p>"What shall we do with such a boy?" cried
the mother. "He seems to carry the burdens of
other boys, old people, animals, and everything
that comes in his way."</p>

<p>"Let him alone," said Father Allen shortly.</p>

<p>"Oh! I wouldn't dare say anything," exclaimed
Mother Allen, alarmed at being misunderstood;
"I was only mentioning the fact."</p>

<p>"You asked a question," said Father Allen,
who was nothing if not exact; "you asked
'What shall we do with him?'"</p>

<p>"And I ask it again," said Mrs. Allen, rubbing
her forehead in a perplexed way, "whatever
in the world shall we do with him?"</p>

<p>"And I answer in the same words that the
immortal Mr. Dick employed on a similar occasion
to Miss Betsey Trotwood's question, 'Wash
him and put him to bed.'"</p>

<p>"We have done that," said his wife with a
laugh, "now, what next?"</p>

<p>"Oh! as to that," replied Father Allen with a
yawn, "I must confess, I don't see my way
clear to furnishing you with an additional
answer. The only one I should suggest is, let
<i>us</i> go to bed."</p>

<p>So the matter was left precisely as it always
remained, for George Edward to follow out his
own instincts, and grow up in his own way to
solve life's greatest problem, "How can I best
serve mankind, and carry out Christ's command
'To do unto others as I would that they should
do to me.'"</p>

<p>This narrative, more devoted to the interests
of St. George and his doings, than to records of
any other boys, will simply state that the morrow's
morning train brought home the recreant
crowd to the bosoms of their waiting families.
The boys of this crowd always mentioned the
old farmer who had passed the night with them,
with an air, though not of fondness, of great
respect. What he did to them to thus inspire
them, I am in no position to know&mdash;I can
only relate that he had great satisfaction in his
part of the evening's entertainment, and that he
simply remarked to Betsey on his return, "I
don't think they'll do that thing again right
away," and that Thomas when recalling the
event, would often pause in his work to allow
himself the brief respite of a smile after careful
observation that revealed no on-looker.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I don't think it pays," some voice at my
elbow might say, as a pair of bright young eyes
have traced thus far George Edward's career,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
"to be always watching to help other people
out of scrapes. 'Look out for yourself' is going
to be my motto."</p>

<p>Just wait, dear little friend. The "boy is
father to the man" we are told, and we recognize
the fact from the first time we meet the
phrase in our readers and copy books. Isn't it
better to be a good father, and turn out a worthy
representative of your family name, that no
chance in life will make one ashamed to meet in
after life? What you call "fun" and "a good
time" and "looking out for yourself" now,
will perhaps carry a different name ten or twenty
years later. It may possibly be known among
men as selfishness, indifference to public good;
or uglier still, sharp, shrewd handling of moneyed
interests committed to your care, to make
them yield benefits to the one who manipulates
them. It may get even to be found deserving the
name of a man who recognizes only the Ego of
human existence, than which, you will quite agree
with me, there is no more hateful being under the
sun. Think well before you give up the habit
of doing the good you can now to those who are
your neighbors, whether at home or at school.</p>

<p>And this brings me to a second period of
George Edward's life, which was fraught with
new responsibilities and pleasures, and which
brought him into a wider field of boyish activity.
He was to go away to boarding-school; the narrow
educational advantages of his home demanding
it.</p>

<p>Before the important decision was reached&mdash;where
to send their boy&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Allen
allowed themselves a whole year to consideration
of the matter. There was not a school of prominence
in the length and breadth of the land, that
in some way did not pass under the keen-eyed
watchfulness of the two parents. Not that they
personally visited them all&mdash;oh dear, no! how
could they? But that in some way, reliable information
of the different school methods, and
the principles and standing of the instructors,
was given into their keeping.</p>

<p>"We never shall find a school where we can
say confidently we will place our boy; never in
all this world," cried Mrs. Allen one day, when
a letter from a friend upset an almost decided
plan of accepting the "Halloway School for
Boys" as the arena for George Edward's
activity. The letter was from a good friend
whom they could trust. It said, "Don't you do
it; the system of instruction is faulty, and the
knowledge obtained is shallow."</p>

<p>Father Allen only said, "Don't worry," buttoned
up his coat and went out to try other fields.</p>

<p>At last came the day when those interested
could announce the thing settled. "George Edward
Allen is going to Doctor Bugbee's school
in Rockboro," and great grief and lamentation
fell upon his old friends&mdash;and who in that
town in which his life was spent, was not glad
to claim that friendship?</p>

<h2>THE CAMEO SET.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a2.jpg" width="72" height="114" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">AGAIN the jewel-case was brought out.
Lucy Ansted's brother had arrived
for a short visit, and taking advantage
of this addition to her forces, Annie
Burton determined to have a tableau
party. Grandma Burton, always interested
in whatever the "the children were up to,"
offered the girls her old-fashioned jewels for
the occasion. But no sooner was the jewel-case
opened than they forgot all about the tableaux
and fell to admiring and asking questions. "These
the only cameos I ever saw that I thought
pretty," said Annie, holding up a handsome set.</div>

<p>"Those <i>are</i> handsome!" said Lucy. "Mamma
has cameos, but they are common-looking things.
Seems to me they cannot be the same kind; I
think there is a difference in the color."</p>

<p>"Very likely," replied Mrs. Burton. "I presume
your mother's are shell cameos. The most
of the modern cameos are made from sea shells.
The shells have two layers of different colors.
Usually the outside is white and the inner layer
brown or coffee-colored. I once had an opportunity
of visiting a cameo cutter's workshop. It
was not easy to get admission, but an artist
friend of your grandfather's took me there."</p>

<p>"Can you tell us about the process?"</p>

<p>"It was many years ago, and my impressions
of what I saw have grown somewhat dim, still
I can tell you something about it. I remember
that he told me that the shell he was cutting
came from the coast of Brazil. Another which
he showed me was from the Bahamas, and he
said that some of those used came from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Indies, both East and West, and also from the
African coast."</p>

<p>"Are the shells used of a peculiar sort?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 277px;">
<img src="images/illus59.jpg" width="277" height="393" alt="Man on stairs looking down at two girls" />
<div class="caption">PREPARING FOR TABLEAUX.</div>
</div>

<p>"They are the ordinary conch-shell. In each
one there is material for only a single cameo,
large or small. The available part is sawed out
by persons employed for that work, who also
shape the cameo by grinding the piece upon a
grindstone, making it square or oval as desired;
then it is ready to be handed over to the artist.
The cutter fastens the shell into a small block
of wood, of a size convenient for grasping firmly
with the left hand. He then draws the outline
of the figure he wishes to put upon it with a
pencil. When the work is outlined upon the
white surface, he begins to scratch the line with
a fine steel needle, following his pencil mark very
carefully. The artist I saw at work inspected
his scratches with a magnifying glass at almost
every scratch of his needle. I call it a needle
because that describes the fine steel tool which
he used. After he had finished the outline he
began to work with small, sharp chisels, cutting
away the white layer of shell around the figure
he had outlined. He worked away carefully,
chipping and scraping until it was all removed,
leaving the portrait of some old Roman a raised
white figure upon a dark ground. It seems
simple enough to hear about it, or to see it done,
but it requires a skilful hand and a practised
eye. There is a finishing process of polishing
with putty powder. This is applied with a stiff
brush and is said to be a very delicate operation,
though it seems as easy as the polishing of a
silver spoon."</p>

<p>Lucy had been turning over the articles in
one of the compartments of the jewel-case and
now held up a small cameo pin.</p>

<p>"That is a shell cameo!" said Grandma; "I
had quite forgotten it. Now if you will observe,
you will see that the edges of the raised white
part are left square-cut, not rounded or sloped."</p>

<p>"Why is that?" asked Lucy.</p>

<p>"If the white layer were cut thinner by the
rounding or sloping of the edges, the dark layer
would show through, and the outline would be
less clearly defined."</p>

<p>"I see! A very simple explanation."</p>

<p>"A great many things are plain after you
know the whys and wherefores."</p>

<p>"But, grandma," said Lucy, "this set of yours&mdash;is
this a shell cameo?"</p>

<p>"No; I was going to tell you about that. It
is very old, and somewhat rare in design and
workmanship. It belonged to your great-grandmother
Burton. It is an onyx. The art of
cutting shell cameos is a modern one. I think
it is not a hundred years since shell cameos were
introduced, but the art of cutting precious stones
like the onyx and agate, in fact, any stone which
has layers of different colors, is very ancient.
The Greeks and Romans understood the art, and
even in Babylonish days it was practised, and
used for the ornamenting of vases, cups, urns."</p>

<p>"There are a few very fine specimens of
antique cameos to be found in Europe. One in
Paris is twelve inches long by ten inches wide.
And the Gonzaga Cameo in St. Petersburg is one
of the finest." It was Grandpa Burton who said
this, joining for the first time in the talk which
drifted to other topics, in which we have just
now no special interest. But Mrs. Burton noticed
that Lucy laid aside the cameos for the tableau
party.</p>

<h3>THE ROSE-GAME.</h3>

<div class='drop-cap'>I WANT to tell you, dear Pansies, of a lovely
little game for the most beautiful month
in the year&mdash;the month of roses. It is played
out-of-doors, of course, in the long, beautiful
sweet evening, when father and mother, and
the older members of the family circle who do
not care to participate actively, can sit on the
porch, or by the open window, and see the
pretty fun go on.</div>

<p>Make a chain of roses, just as one makes a
daisy chain, or a chain of any other flowers.
Use all kinds and colors of roses&mdash;being careful
to distribute shades nicely. String on strong
enough cord or ribbon to support the flowers.</p>

<p>Now choose your leader, either a boy or girl.
Let all players assemble under a tree, or on the
porch. The leader holding chain, comes up to
them, and if addressing a girl, says, bowing
low, "Pretty maid, wilt join us?"</p>

<p>(If to a boy)</p>

<p>"Pretty sir, wilt join us?"</p>

<p>When you have as many as can comfortably
take hold of chain, move off to the smooth
lawn. And here let me say, you better calculate
before making your chain, how many children
will take part in the game. Do not, I beg,
crowd out any who would like to play. Always
remember that a slight like this, or a disappointment,
would make you feel very badly, and
remembering this, make your games to bring
pleasure to every one, and only productive of
happy memories.</p>

<p>Now then, you are on the lawn. The leader
gives the word. All take hold by both hands
of rose-chain, and dance around, singing,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Ring around-a-rosy,<br />
Jack must get a posy,<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>or,</div>

<div class='poem'>
Sue must get a posy,<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>or whatever the name of child who is first sent.
As quick as lightning, Jack or Sue must leave
chain and dancers, rush off into the garden, pick
a flower, no matter what kind, and fly back, the
others holding chain, dancing and singing,</div>

<div class='poem'>
Ring around-a-rosy,<br />
Jack will bring a posy.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>When the posy is brought, Jack throws it into the
centre of ring, on the lawn. Do this until all
players have brought a flower. If gone longer
than they ought to be, they forfeit their places.
When all have brought flowers, the ring dance
around once more, singing,</div>

<div class='poem'>
Ring around-a-rosy,<br />
Each has brought a posy.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Then the leader gives signal to stop. He picks
up the heap of flowers, and, leading the way,
he conducts all players to the porch, where with
a low bow he presents to mother the posy heap,
all singing,</div>

<div class='poem'>
Ring around-a-rosy,<br />
Each brings you now a posy,<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>the leader throwing the rose chain around
mamma's neck&mdash;which <i>entre nous</i>, I think she
will always preserve in her best rose jar.</div>

<p>May the sweetest, longest June evening be
made very happy in playing this Rose-Game.</p>

<h2>THE FLOWER CHORUS.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>THIS may be arranged for twenty, or more,
quite little girls, say in groups of five;
representing roses, lilies, daisies, and pansies.
It would be well to have the children decorated
as much as possible with the flowers they represent,
and let each carry a bouquet of the same.</div>

<p>(<i>Concert Recitation; children arranged in a
semicircle.</i>)</p>

<div class='poem'>
We are Jesus' little Blossoms<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blooming in his bowers;</span><br />
And He watches us and loves us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His little human flowers.</span><br />
Blooming, blooming everywhere,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each of priceless worth,</span><br />
And he bids us reach out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over all the earth.</span><br />
</div>

<p>(<i>As the last line is given, let the children make
a waving motion outward, with the hand that
holds the flowers.</i>)</p>

<h3>THE ROSES.</h3>

<p>(<i>Let the five or more children who represent
them, step slightly forward, and hold their
bouquets just before them, looking down at them,
and appearing to get their perfume as they
speak.</i>)</p>

<div class='poem'>
Our Heavenly Father's roses<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are very sweet and bright;</span><br />
And we should bloom just like them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From morning until night.</span><br />

So he bids us blossom<br />

</div>

<p>If roses are plenty, it makes a very effective
addition to this recitation, for each of the children
to toss out toward the audience, roses, here
and there, as they give the last two lines; not,
however, disturbing their bouquets.</p>

<h3>THE LILIES.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Our Saviour's precious lilies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grew, lovely, at His feet;</span><br />
Oh would that we could blossom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As beautiful and sweet!</span><br />
Blooming, blooming everywhere,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each of priceless worth,</span><br />
So He bids us scatter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over all the earth.</span><br />
</div>

<p>(<i>As the last four lines are given, let the roses
join with the lilies in recitation, waving their
flowers, and scattering them abroad, if this is
feasible.</i>)</p>

<h3>THE DAISIES.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
And these are God's fair daisies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That bloom on plain and hill;</span><br />
We too would blossom like them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And do our Father's will.</span><br />
Blooming, blooming everywhere,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each of priceless worth,</span><br />
So He bids us blossom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over all the earth.</span><br />
</div>

<p>(<i>Let the roses and lilies join, and obey the
directions given above.</i>)</p>

<h3>THE PANSIES.</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Our Father's lovely pansies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Look up, with tender grace;</span><br />
And we would blossom like them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A joy in every place.</span><br />
Blooming, blooming everywhere,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each of priceless worth,</span><br />
So he bids us blossom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over all the earth.</span><br />
</div>

<p>(<i>All join in the last four lines, as before; then
form in a circle, holding up their bouquets in a
compact mass, like a wreath, or crown, and give
the last verse in concert.</i>)</p>

<div class='poem'>
We are all our Father's flowers,<br />
Blooming in His bowers,<br />
And we want to blossom<br />
In valley, plain, or meadow,<br />
In sunshine, storm, or shadow,<br />
Just as sweetly still,<br />
And do our Father's will.<br />
</div>

<p>(<i>Then let them quickly form a procession, and
march around the platform, or down the aisle, or
in any direction in which they are to make their
exit, scattering roses, lilies, daisies and pansies
from their bouquets as they march, singing the
refrain:</i>)</p>

So He bids us blossom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over all the earth.</span><br />
</div>

as it is necessary, in passing out; any simple
tune which the children know, can be used in
singing it.</i>)</p>

<h2>BEN, DAN, AND JACK.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THEY lived in a long, low, rambling
house; it might have been built a century
ago, so queer and old-fashioned
was it. But little cared the boys; they
had good times. Mr. and Mrs. Prentice
believed in boys; and they believed in
boys having good times, always provided the
good did not mean bad. For one thing, the
Prentice boys were allowed to go barefooted.
Now every boy knows that it is fun to go barefoot.
They wore palm leaf hats in summer,
which were not too good to play "pitch and
toss" with. They were allowed to despoil the
squash vines for leaf stalks to make "squawk
pipes," and nice golden pumpkins from the field
were not too precious in the eyes of Farmer
Prentice to be used in making jack-o'-lanterns;
they were allowed to go a-fishing; to go a-berrying,
and to make up nutting parties, and, best
fun of all, when all the neighborhood turned out
to hunt the coons which were destroying the
corn crop, the boys were allowed to join in the
hunt.</div>

<p>How good the green corn roasted by that
midnight fire down in the old pasture lot,
just over the fence from the corn lot, tasted.
And that was the time they learned the secret
of roasting eggs and potatoes in the hot ashes.
How carefully they rolled the eggs in many
layers of brown paper, and then wetting them
thoroughly laid them in the bed made ready, and
covering with the heated ashes they listened for
the cracking of the shells which would tell that
the eggs were done. But these boys did not spend
all their time in just having "good times." Now
and then as they gathered around the kitchen
fire in winter or were grouped in the yard, they
would forget their popping corn or their jack-o'-lantern
and fall to talking over the last book
they had read.</p>

<p>There was no lack of books in the Prentice
home. For if Mr. and Mrs. Prentice believed
in boys, they also believed in books for
boys.</p>

<p>"Any gunpowder under that?" asked Dan
one morning, coming around the corner of the
house and seeing a great pile of kindling wood
which Jack was splitting.</p>

<p>"Not a keg!" was the reply.</p>

<p>"I thought you must be plotting some mischief
or you would never have stuck to the
work long enough to split such a pile as that,"
continued Dan.</p>

<p>"There is a plot, that's a fact," returned
Jack; "but it is not a Gunpowder Plot. I am
going to ask father to let me go with Johnson
when he goes after those cattle, and we shall be
gone three days, so I thought it would advance
my cause a little if the kindlings were all ready
beforehand."</p>

<p>"You are a sharp fellow," said Dan, laughing,
"a very sharp fellow."</p>

<p>"But wasn't that Gunpowder Plot a scheme
though!" said Jack.</p>

<p>"Well, I confess I don't know much about
it," replied Ben, who had in his lazy fashion
thrown himself on the ground. "Just tell a
fellow about it and save him the trouble of
reading it."</p>

<p>"That is what Jack is aching to do," said
Dan, laughing. "Jack is the orator of the
family, you know."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, old fellow," and Ben shifted his
weight from one elbow to the other.</p>

<p>"It was in the reign of James the First; he was
James the Sixth of Scotland; he was the son of
Mary Stuart, and as she was a Catholic, the
Catholics of England supposed her son would
restore, or at least tolerate, the Catholic faith
in England. But they were bitterly disappointed
in this expectation; the old laws
against it were put into execution and others
more severe passed by Parliament. And it was
out of this intolerance that the famous Gunpowder
Plot grew. The scheme was to blow up
with gunpowder the Parliament House, while
Parliament was in session, and so destroy the
king and members of Parliament. There was
a vault under the building which the conspirators
hired as a salesroom for wood and coal.
They put in stealthily thirty-six barrels of gunpowder
and then covered these with the wood
and prepared a train so that the whole could be
fired at once. They had a ship ready to take
Fawkes on board&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've got ahead of your story! tell us
who was Fawkes."</p>

<p>"He was one of the conspirators, a Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
officer who superintended the business and was
to touch it off. Authorities do not quite agree
as to how the secret leaked out. It is supposed
that one of the conspirators wanted to save
some of his friends and so warned them to keep
away from the Parliament House on the day
set for the execution of the plot, and suspicion
was thus aroused, and Guy Fawkes was arrested
just as he was about to apply the match to the
train. He was tried and executed along with
several others. The day set for the horrible
deed was the fifth of November, 1605, and it
has ever since been observed as a holiday in
England."</p>

<p>"You've done well," said Dan. "But you
left out a lot; you forgot to tell how they first
hired a house next to the place where Parliament
was held and tried to dig through the
walls."</p>

<p>"I did not forget it, but it amounted to nothing
and they abandoned that plan, and I thought
Ben could read that up for himself. I have
noticed that if you tell him a part of a story
he will go and find out the rest. The best way
is, to tell him just enough to whet his curiosity."</p>

<p>Dan was half-way to the barn before this
remark was ended, but glancing back he saw
Ben and Jack down on the grass <i>having it out</i>
in a regular "rough and tumble."</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear Pansies</span>:</div>

<p>Will every one of you put on your "thinking
caps" and give careful attention to what I am
about to say? All summer I am to be away
from home; in Kansas, Wisconsin, Nebraska, and
I hardly know where else; flitting from one city
to another, only a few days in a place. As a consequence,
unless you pay close attention, I shall
not be able to hear from you. Because letters
will fail to reach me. But I shall have a secretary
who will stay all summer at Chautauqua,
Chautauqua Co., N. Y. If you address me <i>at
that place</i>, she will get the letters, attend to the
business part of them, and see that they are
sent to me. Will you remember, and send letters
to me at Chautauqua, instead of Cincinnati,
or Carbondale, or any other place?</p>

<p>This direction holds good for the months of
June, July, August and September. After that,
I will give you other information.</p>

<p>Another thing, <i>do not send subscription
money for</i> <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> <i>to me; but always to D.
Lothrop &amp; Co., Boston</i>.</p>

<p>When you want badges, send name and
pledge to me; also ten cents in postage stamps,
unless you are a subscriber. Subscribers are
entitled to badges free of charge. All letters
about <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>, or about your work or plans,
all questions connected with the P. S. are to be
sent to my address; but <i>remember</i>, when you
want to subscribe for <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>, send your
dollar directly to Boston.</p>

<p>Years ago we used to have a department in
<span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> which met with much favor. This
was a letter or article by the Editor, containing
all the words which had been misspelled or improperly
used during the month, by young correspondents;
of course no names were mentioned.</p>

<p>We have determined to begin in July, a
similar exercise, continuing it so long as there
shall be any call for it. If, during any month,
all letters received have been correct as to spelling,
punctuation, capitals, grammar, etc., you
may know it by the absence of the "queer-looking"
article the following month.</p>

<p>Each member of the P. S. is expected to
carefully read and correct the article. If you
choose to report to me your success, I shall be
glad; but this is not a rule.</p>

<p>A good plan would be to have an exercise in
your local societies, the president giving out
the words from <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>, and each member
writing them, as he or she thinks they ought to
be; then let the papers be exchanged and read,
first appointing an umpire, dictionary in hand,
to decide as to correctness.</p>

<p>Look out for my first letter, next month.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear Pansies</span>:</div>

<p>Through the bright summer months, while
away at seashore, or mountains, we know
there will come many idle moments when it is
too hot to play, and when books do not engross.
In these moments, may you hear the voices of
those patient little ones, who, too sick and suffering
to play out of doors, are lying on beds
of suffering, only knowing of the green fields,
and cool brooks, and lovely summer-tide places,
from their memories, or from what others tell
them. At such moments, oh, dear Pansies, let
your fingers be busy in making those things
that you know children like them would enjoy,
and your tongues be active, interesting the other
children of the hotel or the boarding-house in this
ministry of love. It is now some four years
since the Pansy Society was formed. Its members
are legion, from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
and it has done much noble work. But we aim
for great results, and we mean this summer to
accomplish much good. We wonder which of
our workers will lead.</p>

<div class='sig'>
M. S.<br />
</div>

<hr class="short" />
<p><i>Walter</i> from Virginia. Another sunshiny
face will give light in the home, if you keep
your pledge, my boy, as I seem to feel sure you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
will. It is easy to find something to look cross
at; almost anybody can do that; but the people
are rather few who can look pleasant when
things do not go just right. The few who do
this, are among the most helpful people we have
in the world.</p>

<p><i>Clara</i> from Nova Scotia. A five-year-old
Pansy blooming in Nova Scotia! Isn't that
delightful? She is just like all the other little
Blossoms, too; troubled with weeds; doesn't
like to obey promptly, and "wants her own
sweet little way, sometimes, instead of mamma's."
But like a brave Blossom she is going to try to
get rid of these weeds and grow beautifully for
the great Gardener. We welcome you heartily
to the P. S., and hope you will train "Agnes"
and "Margaret" so well, that they will join us
very soon.</p>

<p><i>May</i> from Virginia. Little seven-year-old
May flower, I give you greeting. It is such an
easy thing for bright little tongues to "answer
back!" How glad I am that now, while you are
so young, you are going to overcome the bad
habit! Why, here is brother Chester in your
letter! We are glad to welcome him. What a
large pledge he has taken! Part of it you are
very glad to hear, I know. Chester, my boy, I
hope you will succeed. Write and let me know
how you are getting on.</p>

<p><i>Edith</i> from California. "Selfishness" is a
weed which seems to thrive in a great many
States. I am not surprised to hear that California
has its share. Glad you are going to
root it from your grounds. I have ordered the
missing number of <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> sent to you.</p>

<p><i>Lowrie</i> from Washington Territory. So you
do not mean the rest of us shall know what
fault you are striving to overcome? Well, never
mind; so that you and Jesus know about it,
that is all that is really necessary. But if you
honestly try, there are others who will know
about it. You may not hear them, but they will
be saying among themselves: "How much
Lowrie is improving! Don't you know how
often he used to give way to that fault of his?
Now he hardly ever does." When your dear
"chubby" fingers get so they can write, send
me word how you are prospering, and whether
you find the badge a help.</p>

<p><i>Calvert</i> from Indiana. Here is a boy who is
going to stop "putting off things." Good! I
wish you lived with a boy friend of mine long
enough for him to adopt your resolve. He
troubles all his friends so much with that very
habit! Perhaps he will read this letter, and
join you. I am glad you try to increase the
circulation of <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>. If every Blossom
on our list should get one new subscriber a
year, even, what a <i>great</i> new garden we should
have!</p>

<p><i>Nora</i> from Minnesota. What sort of a "face"
is it, my dear? I suspect, a cross one; for I know
several people who do not like to "practise."
Suppose you resolve to wear a smile, whenever
you are told to do that wearisome thing? In
which case, you would be sure to keep your
pledge. Wouldn't you?</p>

<p><i>Annie</i> from Missouri. Five new subscribers
in a week! What a bright little worker it is!
A "quick" temper is not a bad thing to have,
when it is a servant, and not a mistress. So
long as you keep it under good control, it will
help you to move quickly, and work quickly,
and think quickly. Did you know that?</p>

<p><i>Amy</i> from New York. My dear Blossom, I
want to preach a little sermon to you, with one
word for a text: PATIENCE. I know you
have had to wait long for the answer to your
letter; but what would you do if you were the
editor of a magazine, which was published once
a month, and had room in it for replies to only
a dozen or twenty letters each month, and you
received as many as twenty-five a day? You
"would make shorter answers," I think I hear
you say. That is a good suggestion; I have
thought about it myself; but there is always so
much to say! I am sorry to hear that you have
not kept your pledge very well, but the old
motto which my dear mother used to quote to
me, when I was a very little girl, is a good one for
you: "If at first you don't succeed, try, try
again."</p>

<p><i>Nellie</i> from Maine. So I had the honor of
receiving the first letter you ever wrote! I am
pleased with that. A good letter it was, too. I
have just been reading about a little girl in
California who has a habit of fretting; and now
I find that they have the same disease in Maine!
Well, I am glad to know that there will be less
of it from this time. It is sometimes very hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
work to obey promptly. You will have to keep
careful watch of yourself; but it will be a triumph
worth winning, when you form the habit.</p>

<p><i>Winnie</i> and <i>Helen</i> from Minnesota. I am
always glad to welcome sisters; for I know how
helpful they can be to each other. When we
have two, patient, lady-like, sweet Pansies who
speak only gentle words, how sweet the perfume
will be! Perhaps the breath of such flowers
will creep all over the State of Minnesota! You
don't think that possible? Oh, yes indeed. I
have known a sweet breath from a little human
flower, reach from New York to China. Try
how far you can make your perfume reach.</p>

<p><i>Lucy</i> from Massachusetts. Poor fingernails!
I am always so sorry for those faithful friends
when they have to be bitten. I will hope for
better times with yours. It is astonishing how
many warm friends Nettie Decker has! She is
a favorite of mine, so I am glad you like her. I
read your letter to the author of "My Brainless
Acquaintance" and he expressed much pleasure
at the thought that you enjoyed it. I hope you
will give the "baby brother" a kiss for me.</p>

<p><i>Margie</i> from Massachusetts. That is the
trouble, my dear little girl: So many people are
naughty "before they think."</p>

<p>I know of only one way to learn how to think,
and that is, to ask Jesus to keep your thoughts
on what he wants you to remember. You must
always remember that it "takes two to make a
quarrel;" so if you will not quarrel with any
person, no one can quarrel with you.</p>

<p><i>Helen</i> and <i>Frank</i> from Maryland. Dear little
brother and sister, we are very glad to receive
your names. There are a great many things to
"get mad" over. I heard a little boy say, yesterday,
that when he was in any trouble, he
always got mad. I asked if that helped him
any, and he owned that he thought it made the
matter worse. It is pleasant to think that
Frank will watch his temper, after this. And
as for you, Helen, I shall expect to hear that
you make a great deal of sunshine from this
time.</p>

<p><i>Mary</i> from Minnesota. Dear little Blossom,
with "ever so many bad habits," what a work
you have before you. But if you will hold your
ear close, and not tell anybody, I will whisper
a secret to you. Every little girl I know, has
ever so many, also. The difference between
them is only, that some are trying to overcome,
and some are not. Let me tell you that is a
<i>very great difference;</i> one that will reach all
through life. It is so good to think that our
little Mary belongs to those who are trying.</p>

<p><i>Ned</i> and <i>Willie</i> from "Home." Well, my
dear boys, that was what you said; and glad
am I that you can date your letters from home,
but I wish I knew in what State it was! I might
have looked at the envelope, it is true, but I
"forgot" and threw it away. Never mind, <i>you</i>
know where you live, and I hope will never
forget that it is the best place in the world.
What a comfort to think of the hats and satchels,
and all the other school belongings carefully put
away, instead of being tossed on a chair, or
under the table, or anywhere. Oh! I know all
about it. A boy of my acquaintance pitched
his hat into the milk pitcher the other day!
Neither the hat nor the boy felt so well afterwards.
As for that habit of "exaggerating" it
is astonishing as well as sad, to think how it
will grow. Not long ago I repeated a remark
which a lady made, who had called on me; I
was at once asked where I heard it, and I mentioned
the lady's name. "Oh," said my friend,
"that is probably not true; I have not heard of
it, and I think I certainly should have, if it had
been so. As for Miss &mdash;&mdash;, you cannot credit
anything she says." Then noticing my astonished
look, she added earnestly: "I am sorry
to tell you so; but it is the truth. Not that I
think she intends to be false, but she has such a
sad habit of exaggerating, that really no one
pretends to believe her stories." Think of it!</p>

<p><i>Florence</i> from Pennsylvania. A "grumbler"
is a very uncomfortable person, certainly. By
all means let us uproot the weed from our Pansy
Beds. Thank your dear mamma for her kind
words.</p>

<p><i>Willie</i> from Minnesota. Oh! I understand all
about that habit; it causes a great deal of annoyance
in this world. Only a few minutes ago, a
boy rushed into the room where his mother was
engaged with callers, and shouted, "Mamma,
may I go to the lake a little while?" The question
broke into the midst of this sentence which
the caller was trying to say: "What a gentlemanly
boy you have, Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;. I admire his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
manners very much!" Don't you think both she
and the mother must have <i>admired</i> him at that
moment? I congratulate your mother on the
pledge you have taken.</p>

<p><i>Mattie</i> from New Hampshire. There are a
great many faults to struggle against, it is true;
but those who overcome are always those who
earnestly wish to do so. Certainly our Pansies
have a great many ill-treated fingernails! We
are glad to hear of improvements in that direction.</p>

<p><i>Belle</i> from New York. You have a hard task
before you, my dear; I know by experience how
easy it is to speak cross words. But when we
remember how they sting, and what harm they
often do, which can never be undone, we will
surely try to give only "soft answers."</p>

<p><i>Freddie</i> from Connecticut. What a long
word you chose to struggle with&mdash;Impulsiveness.
I ask a boy, near me, what it means, and
he says: "Oh, it means rushing off to do things,
before a fellow knows whether he ought to, or
not." If his definition is good&mdash;do you accept
it?&mdash;I think you have made a wise pledge.</p>

<p><i>Robbie</i> from Maine. It is queer how many
boys I know who are like my Pansy Blossoms,
scattered all over this big world of ours. A
boy friend of mine hates to go to the post-office
at just the time when he ought; and he
so often says, "Won't it do by and by?" that
he has earned the name of "By and by."</p>

<p><i>Mabel</i> from Pennsylvania. If one only keeps
one's eyes wide open, my dear, it is very easy
to see things with which to find fault; it is wise
to learn to shut one's eyes, on occasion, to the
faults of others. I am glad you have taken the
pledge. Remember me to your dear mother,
and thank her for her kind words.</p>

<p><i>Jessie</i> from Missouri. People who are "patient
about everything" are very scarce, and
very lovely. I am glad to think of Jessie as trying
for this. By all means "get out" of that habit
of which you speak. You will be a comfort to
the teacher as well as a help to your classmates,
if you do. I am sorry you have been sick.
Your letter was well written, and gave me great
pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Florence</i> from Iowa. Did you ever hear of
the little girl whose father gave her a birthday
present of a necklace of little thorns, because
her tongue said so many sharp and spiteful
words? He told her he had intended to make the
necklace of beautiful beads, but had decided
that thorns would match her style better. Such
a necklace would not fit you, now, would it? I
rejoice over your pledge.</p>

<p><i>Edwin</i> and <i>Harold</i> from Maine. Of course
we will receive the little brother. A boy five
years old can keep a pledge as well as an older
person; sometimes better. I hope there will be
fewer tears shed in your home than ever before;
also, that my boy Edwin will become noted for
the prompt manner in which he obeys all right
calls.</p>

<p><i>Maud</i> from Pennsylvania. Impatient people
are always "nervous;" did you know it? I had
an old aunt who used to say that "nervous"
was a new-fashioned word, which she did not
believe in; that in her day, they called it
"cross." That is pretty hard on the nerves,
isn't it? I don't agree with her. Sometimes
those nerves twinge in a very disagreeable manner;
but the strong will which they are trying
to twist, gets the better of them, and gentle
patience is the result. I hope you will succeed.</p>

<p><i>Beverly</i> from Maryland. My boy, you are
growing rich, are you not? So many dear
friends already in Heaven, waiting and watching
for you. Would it not be sad if their boy
should do anything to grieve them? I hope
your badge will be helpful. I see no sparrows
about me, but while I write, the mocking-birds
are singing in the pine trees near by.</p>

<p><i>Arthur</i> from Pennsylvania. I like your
verses very much. As soon as I have time, I
shall copy them for the magazine. I am afraid
"Reaching Out" must close with October, as I
have another story waiting, which I think you
boys, particularly, will like quite as well as
"Reaching Out."</p>

<p><i>Ellen</i> from Kansas. It is quite a common
thing for people to see the faults of others, and
be blind to their own. Queer, isn't it? Do you
remember the old Scotch poem:</p>

<div class='poem'>
O wad some power the giftie gie us,<br />
To see ourselves as ithers see us!<br />
It wad from mony a blunder free us,<br />
And foolish notion.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>There is a wise old man who says that people
are pretty sure to see in others the very failings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
which they themselves possess. What do you
think of it? I am much interested in your
"literary cat." What branch of study does she
appear to be taking up?</div>

<p><i>Arthur</i> from Tennessee. You had a chance
to exercise patience in waiting for your badge,
did you not? I do not know why some of the
badges seem to think they must be so long on
the road, unless it is to help their owners to a
little of that quality. Don't you think it is
generally a scarce article with boys?</p>

<p><i>Birdie</i> from Kentucky. O yes, Birdie, we
have a great many Blossoms in Kentucky, only
we have not answered their letters yet. There
are many hundreds still waiting. My dear little
girl, do you think one has to "try" very hard
to love such a Friend as Jesus? I suspect you
mean that you have not learned to love Him
enough to obey Him perfectly. That is a hard
lesson; it gives me joy to think you are trying
to learn it.</p>

<p><i>Gertrude</i> from Missouri. "Things" seem to
be determined to lie around in the way. All
over the country I notice that the P. S. Blossoms
have the same trouble. They will certainly
have to be willing to hang on hooks, and
nails, or lie quietly on clothespress shelves; for
the P. S. has gotten hold of them with determined
wills. We are glad of a recruit from
Missouri.</p>

<p><i>Sallie</i> from Massachusetts. I like to hear of
an interested reader of my books, but, Sallie
dear, do not let them lead you astray. I once
went to call on a woman who needed help. It
was nearly twelve o'clock, but her breakfast
table still stood in the middle of the floor, black
with flies; the little mass of oil in which some
of them were drowning, had once been butter;
her baby was playing with the coal hod, and his
face and clothes were the color of it; and everything
about the room was in disorder. The
mother sat in the one rocking-chair, wiping her
eyes over a story which she was reading. "I
ought to a done up my work," she said, "but
land, I do love to read. I always was literary!"
You will never be such a woman as that! I hear
you say. No, I do not think you will. Especially
since you have taken your pledge.</p>

<p><i>Helen</i> from Missouri. Poor little Blossom!
You have had a hard experience. My heart
aches for you; but I am hoping that before this
time you are well. I once knew of a boy who
was sent to mend a sidewalk, and did his work
so poorly, that his mother tripped on the place
and broke her limb. I hope no careless boy
was the cause of all your suffering. There is a
Bible verse for you; did you know it? Look at
the latter part of Matthew 8:17.</p>

<p><i>Susie</i> from Ohio. Welcome, little worker. I
hope the new society prospered; let us know
how you conduct your meetings, for what are
you working, and all about it. With your dear
father and mother waiting for you in Heaven,
you will want to be sure not to disappoint them.
I hope to meet you there.</p>

<p><i>Kittie</i> and <i>France</i> from New York. To
"obey promptly" and to avoid all words and
ways which come under the head of "contradicting"
are very important things to accomplish.
May you and "little sister" be great helps to
each other. I am glad you like "Grandma Burton."</p>

<p><i>Charlie</i> from Missouri. There was no trouble
in reading your letter, Charlie. I wish all my
correspondents would write as plainly. Oh
poor birds! Don't neglect them. If they
could fly away in the free air, I think they
would feed themselves; but since they can't,
help them. As for the wood, perhaps it would
come in of its own accord if it had feet. Who
knows? But since it hasn't, Charlie must be brisk
feet for it. "Do with your might what your
hands find to do." Isn't that a good motto?</p>

<p><i>Millie</i> from Pennsylvania. I am sorry you
had such long waiting for your badges. Your
first letter must have gone a journey around the
world, for I have never seen it. However, I hope
it has all been made right at last. If I were not
so far away, I would be tempted to accept your

<p><i>Maud</i> from Pennsylvania. So you "talk too
loud!" Well, you have plenty of company. I
know a boy who has to be reminded several times
a day, that none of his friends are deaf. Are
you ever just a trifle out of patience when your
voice is loud? It affects some people in that

Don't you think so? Try it, my boy. Watch

<p>Nearly two years ago I was visiting a friend
in East St. Louis, and she showed me <span class="smcap">The
Pansy</span>, and mamma liked it so well she said I
might subscribe for it, and you cannot imagine
how I have enjoyed it. I take the <i>St. Nicholas</i>
also. Now, dear Pansy, I am going to confide
to you my great fault, which is not putting
things in their places. It worries mamma and
it worries everybody around the house to see my
cap in one place, my cloak in another, my skates
in another. I will promise to keep the pledge
and always keep the Whisper Motto in mind, for
nothing can be done without Jesus' help. I
would like a badge. I have no little brothers
or sisters, and as none of my little friends take
<span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>, I cannot get up a society.</p>

<p>I am a little girl nine years old. Sometimes
I am very thoughtless, and that is what I got
my badge in August for. I think it has helped
me some. The Whisper Motto, "For Jesus'
Sake," has helped me a heap. I think <span class="smcap">The

Fishers and their Nets" is the nicest story I
ever read. I have two little sisters, Daisy, six
years old, and Alice, three years old.</p>

<p>I have been very much interested in reading
the little letters from different children, and I
thought I would write too. May I tell you
something about myself? I have had spinal
disease for years, and am obliged to lie in bed
all the time.</p>

<p>I am in a hospital where are many children;
those who are able to be up, go to school in the
mornings, and in the afternoon the teacher
comes up stairs to give little lessons to those
who are in bed.</p>

<p>The children have books, toys, games, and
hobby horses. The girls like to play "hospital,"
with their dollies, and have two or three boys
for doctors. The dolls are treated as though
they really felt sick; and the young doctors
pretend to give them ether, before they perform
their surgical operations! It is quite funny to
see how the very little boys and girls will imitate
doctors and nurses.</p>

<p>The children have a little society called the
"Ready-To-Help." Sometime I will tell you
of some of the things which its members do to
help.</p>

<p>We have a beautiful Pansy bed. We have
about twenty-five Blossoms. Some are big, and
some are little; some are golden color, and some
are deep purple. When the Pansies meet, the
Vice-President takes the P. S. roll book, goes
to each Blossom and gets the record for the
month. I have promised to be patient, and to
speak kindly. Willie's pledge was to try to
keep his temper; and his record was: "I forgot
a few times, but it helped; and I mean to
try harder." One dark Pansy promised to
brush her teeth at least once a day, and not
to be selfish.</p>

<p>The garden is growing very nicely; by and
by we are going to plant new seeds. The last
time we met we played a nice game; we all
stood around the table, and fished with poles.
The wee Blossoms were very much delighted.</p>

I was injured by falling through a sidewalk.
I had to lie in bed for thirteen months

<p>Mamma says I ought to tell you at the commencement
that I am eleven years old, but a
poor penman, and she is afraid you cannot read
my letter, but I will try and do my best. I
have taken <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> for two years, and enjoy
it very much. I get so interested in "Reaching
Out" that I am almost impatient for the
numbers to come. After reading them, I send
them away in our mission barrel to the children
in Utah. I would like to keep them; but
mamma thinks we ought to let some one else
enjoy them. I have read nearly all your books.
From reading "Pocket Measure" I learned how
nice it was to give. Mamma especially likes
"Mrs. Solomon Smith."</p>

<p>I would like to join the P. S. I have tried
for a week to decide on the fault that I needed
most to overcome; but I do not know which
one it is, I have so many. (It seems to me as
though every one else had but one fault.) I
know one of mine is not obeying quickly, when
mamma speaks. I would rather read your books
and magazine than do my work. I <i>do</i> like to
read very much. Another fault is a quick temper.
I pray over my faults and try to overcome
them; I want to lead my dear friends to the
Saviour, but I have so many faults! I think I
will wear my badge for them all. I have a
picture of you; papa is going to have it framed

<h2>"UP HILL AND DOWN DALE."</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>ANOTHER new book! It is astonishing
how many beautiful books these Pansies
seem to think they need. Well, "Up Hill and
Down Dale" is delightful enough to make your
eyes shine. Two hundred pages, and numberless
pictures, one of which I put before you.</div>

<p>The book is written by Laura D. Nichols;
and those of the Pansies who have read her
"Overhead" and "Underfoot," need no further
introduction to this book. They know they will
like it. For the rest of you, you need to get
acquainted with sweet, womanly little Nelly
Marlow, and her good brother Harry. You
want to know how they went to the country,
leaving Harry behind to be brave and manly at
his uncle's; how Nelly cared for her mother's
breakfast, and even, with "Miss Gage's" help,
went into the furniture business, and manufactured
a lovely table for the somewhat barely
furnished room.</p>

<p>This is only a hint of her helpfulness, and her
wise sweet ways. Plenty of fun she had, too;
and a most astonishing way of making friends
with everybody, and having unexpectedly good
times because they liked to have her with them.
Just let me give you a taste of one of the days
which her good friend Dave planned for her:</p>

<p>"'Say, Nelly,' he began, 'do you want to go
up to Hackmatack to-morrow?'</p>

<p>"'Of course I do!' cried she; 'who's going?'</p>

<p>"'Well, Abner is, an' I be, an' Sam, an' Sam's
father. There's an ol' house an' barn half-way
up the mounting, where 'Siah Buckman's folks
used to live, an' they're all gone out West, an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Abner an' Sam's father have bought the standin'
grass on the halves, an' we're goin' up to cut it.
Miss Gage said she'd like to go, if you would,
an' there's a woman an' her boy boardin' at
Sam's an' mebbe they'll go too. You could take
your dinner and have a kind of a picnic.'</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 471px;">
<img src="images/illus84.jpg" width="471" height="600" alt="gathering sap in buckets in snow" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">in sap time.</span>&mdash;<i>From "Up Hill and Down Dale."</i></div>
</div>

<p>"'O, that would be perfectly lovely!' cried
Nelly. 'I'm so glad you thought of it. I'll go
and ask mother now. Good-night, aunty, I'll
come and tell you all about it, if we go.'</p>

<p>"Mrs. Marlow was well pleased that her
daughter should have a whole day out-of-doors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
under such safe escort, and assured her that,
although she should miss her, she would be fully
recompensed by hearing of her adventures.</p>

<p>"The next day proved as perfect a hay-day
as could be desired. Abner, Mr. Burns and Sam
had an early breakfast, and were off before six
o'clock, with their scythes and rakes in the
Burns's single wagon, leaving Dave to follow
with a two-seated one, bringing the ladies and
dinner pails. The boarders from Sam's house
proved to be a Mrs. Symonds, a gayly dressed
and lively young woman, and her little boy
Ambrose, a quiet child eight or nine years old.</p>

<p>"'You're sure you'll not be lonely, mamma?'
whispered Nelly, giving her mother a parting hug.</p>

<p>"'Not a bit lonely, dear; I'm going to write
a long letter to cousin Miranda, and take it to
the office myself, for I slept better than usual
after my walk yesterday.'</p>

<p>"This sent Nelly off with a happy face;
Wealthy pushed in the last basket, and away
they went, at as good speed as Dave could get
from old 'Peach who had been a colt at the time
of the great impeachment trial in Washington.</p>

<p>"Their way lay first through the village,
which Dave, half-proud and half-ashamed of
his load of ladies, was rather glad to leave
behind. Then came a cool, shady mile in the
woods, the road slowly ascending between noble
maple-trees.</p>

<p>"'I don't believe there's a handsomer maple-orchard
in the State,' said Dave. 'You jest
oughter be here in sap-time, Nelly! You could
ride up here on the sled an' help me an' Sam
empty the buckets, an' there'll be a big fire
under the kettle in the sap-house over there'&mdash;pointing
to a rough shed with a chimney, near
the roadside; 'an' you could drink all the sap,
an' eat all the sugar you wanted.'</p>

<p>"'Why! Is it here that maple-sugar comes
from?' exclaimed Mrs. Symonds, who did not
know much about the country; and Dave willingly
pointed out the half-healed holes in the
bark of the trees they were passing, and explained
how the little wooden conductors were
fitted in, to lead the sap into the pails and
troughs placed below, and how it was afterwards
boiled down to sugar, or made into luscious
syrup. She and Ambrose at once declared that
they would stay in Hickory Corners to see this
delightful work, and were much disappointed
when Dave with a grin, informed them that it
was usually done in March, and that he had
once had his ears frozen, from staying too long
in the woods.</p>

<p>"'But you told me that Sam's sister used to
help,' said Nelly reproachfully, as she and Dave
here jumped out to walk up hill, leaving the
reins to Miss Gage; 'and you said you wished
I could be here.'</p>

<p>"'Well, an' so I do, an' so Susy did,' retorted
the boy; 'but <i>she</i> has sense enough to dress up
for cold weather, an' so would you have, but
that woman hain't. Look at her now! What
sort of shoes are them for goin' up a mounting?
an' where'll all them ruffles be, by night?'</p>

<p>"It was too true that Mrs. Symonds' flounced
and lace-edged muslin was most unfit for the
excursion, and her French shoes ill-adapted for
walking, but Nelly did not think it polite to
criticise her to Dave, so she was glad to change
the subject.</p>

<p>"'O, there is some Indian pipe!' she exclaimed,
darting out of the road to pick a cluster
of the pure, sculptured-looking flowers,
growing at the foot of a giant hemlock. She
ran to the wagon to show them to Miss Gage
and Mrs. Symonds.</p>

<p>"'O how exquisite!' cried the latter lady,
'how exactly like wax! Do give me one!'</p>

<p>"But when Nelly did so, and she had put it
to her nose, she exclaimed in great disgust, and
said she didn't believe it was a flower at all,
only a horrid toad-stool, and it had spoiled her
gloves; she threw it indignantly into the dusty
road."</p>

<p>There is no use, I might as well stop at one
point as another. The interest does not stop,
but extends all through the book. I hope you
will have the pleasure of reading it for yourselves.
It is beautifully bound in colors. The
usual price is one dollar and twenty-five cents;
but the P. S. members are offered it for seventy-five
cents. I am sure you will agree with me that
it is a very rare opportunity to secure a book by
such an author, and of such size, full of interesting
and instructive truth, for seventy-five
cents. After you have read it carefully, I should
like to hear from you, as to what you have
learned that gave you special interest.</p>

<p>The works issued in this library are uniformly of a high standard and may well come under that class of literature
styled "home fiction," a literature, that, while free from the flashy, sensational effect of much of the fiction of to-day, is,
nevertheless, brilliant in style, fresh and strong in action, and of absorbing interest. It is a class that all the young folks,
as well as the fathers and mothers and older brothers and sisters, may read with profit as well as great pleasure.</p>

<p><b>1. THE PETTIBONE NAME, by Margaret Sidney</b>, author of <i>The Five Little Peppers</i>, etc. It is a delightful
story of New England life and manners, sparkling in style, bright and effective in incident, and of intense interest.
There has been no recent figure in American fiction more clearly or skilfully drawn than Miss Judith Pettibone. Most
of the characters of the book are such as may be met with in any New England village.</p>

<p><b>2. MY GIRLS. By Lida A. Churchill.</b> A story of four ambitious girls. Their struggles to realize their
ambitions and their trials and successes, make a story of intense interest.</p>

<p><b>3. WITHIN THE SHADOW, by Dorothy Holroyd.</b> "The most successful book of the year." "The
plot is ingenious, yet not improbable, the character drawing strong and vigorous, the story throughout one of brilliancy
and power." "The book cannot help making a sensation."&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<p><b>4. FAR FROM HOME.</b> From the German of Johannes Van Derval. Translated by <b>Kathrine Hamilton</b>.
A fascinating story of life and travel in foreign lands.</p>

<p><b>5. GRANDMOTHER NORMANDY. By the author of Silent Tom.</b> The story is fascinatingly told.
The character of Grandmother Normandy, stern, relentless and unforgiving, almost to the last, is strongly drawn, and
the author has shown much skill in the construction of the story.</p>

<p><b>6. AROUND THE RANCH. By Belle Kellogg Towne.</b> It is original, fresh, and written with great

<div class='adtitle2'><span class="smcap">prospectus&mdash;OUR LITTLE MEN AND WOMEN&mdash;for 1886.</span></div>

<div class='hang1'>This magazine, for youngest readers, has earned golden gratitude from teachers and parents
this past year. While its short stories and beautiful pictures have made it welcome everywhere as a
general Magazine for Little Folks, its series of instructive articles have rendered it of unrivalled value
to educators. For 1886 several specialties have been prepared in accordance with the suggestions of
teachers who wish to start their "little primaries" in the lines on which older brothers and sisters are
being taught. As a beginning in American History, there will be twelve charming chapters about</div>


<div class='adtitle4'>THE ADVENTURES OF COLUMBUS.</div>

<div class='hang1'>This story of the Great Discoverer, while historically correct and valuable, will be perfectly
adapted to young minds and fitted to take hold upon a child's attention and memory; many pictures.</div>


<div class='adtitle4'>LITTLE TALKS ABOUT INSECT LIFE</div>

<div class='hang1'>will interest the children in one branch of Natural History; with anecdotes and pictures.</div>


<div class='adtitle4'>OUR COLORADO PETS</div>

<div class='hang1'>will describe wild creatures little known to children in general. These twelve stories all
are true, and are full of life and adventure; each will be illustrated.</div>


<div class='adtitle4'>"ME AND MY DOLLS"</div>

<div class='hang1'>is a "cunning little serial story," written for American children by the popular English
author, Miss L. T. Meade. It will have Twelve Full-page Pictures by Margaret Johnson.</div>

<div class='hang1'>From time to time fresh "Stories about Favorite Authors" will be given, so that teachers
and friends may have material for little literature lessons suited to young children.</div>

<div class='adtitle2'><span class="smcap">prospectus&mdash;<big>THE PANSY</big>&mdash;for 1886.</span></div>

<div class='hang1'>For both week-day and Sunday reading, <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>, edited by "Pansy" herself, holds the
first place in the hearts of the children, and in the approval of earnest-minded parents. Among the more
interesting features for 1886 will be Pansy's serial story,</div>


<div class='adtitle4'>REACHING OUT,</div>

<div class='hang1'>being a further account of "Little Fishers: and their Nets." The Golden Text Stories,
under the title, "Six O'clock in the Evening," will be told by a dear old Grandma, who knows many interesting
things about what happened to herself when she was a little girl. Margaret Sidney will furnish
a charming story,</div>


<div class='adtitle4'>ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGON,</div>

<div class='hang1'>to run through the year. Rev. C. M. Livingston will tell stories of discoveries, inventions,
books, people, places. Faye Huntington will be a regular contributor during the year. Pansy will
take the readers with her wherever she goes, in papers under the title of</div>


<div class='adtitle4'>WHERE I WENT, AND WHAT I SAW.</div>

<div class='hang1'>There will be, in each number, a selection from our best standard poets suitable for recitation
in school or circle. From time to time colloquies for Mission Bands, or for general school exercises,
will appear. There will be new and interesting books for the members of the Pansy Society, and, as
before, a generous space will be devoted to answers to correspondents in the P. S. Corner.</div>

<p>The entire framework is made from Iron, painted
and Japanned black, and ornamented with red and gilt
stripes.</p>

<p>All parts made to interchange.</p>

<p>1. The Bearings to the Arms are carefully sized to
bring them in perfect line. (This is a vital point in the
construction of any Jig Saw.)</p>

<p>2. Each machine is provided with a Dust Blower,
which is a very great advantage.</p>

<p>3. Our machine has a jointed Stretcher Rod, which
allows the operator to throw the upper arm out of the
way when adjusting his work or saw. This joint also
permits the machine to work much more freely than
with a straight iron rod.</p>

<p>4. Our clamps have a hinged jaw which overcomes
the disagreeable raking overthrow of the blade, which
is unavoidable when the saws are secured rigidly to the
arms. Saw blades are not nearly so liable to break
when clamps have this joint. Thus a large percentage
of the expense of running the saw is saved. Besides
this the saw runs much easier, the swing coming at the
hinge instead of bending the blade with each stroke of
the saw.</p>

<p>5. The Balance wheel is 4<sup>1</sup><small>/</small><sub>4</sub> inches in diameter,
with a handsome spoke centre and Rim of Solid Emery.</p>

<p>6. The attachment for Drilling is on the Right Hand
Side of the machine, which, for convenience, is an obvious
advantage.</p>

<p>7. No Pins are used in the construction of this machine,
as we prefer the durability of nicely fitted screws
and bolts in securing each part.</p>

<p>While the New Rogers' Saw is very rich, though not gaudy in appearance, it has been more especially
our object to make, for the least possible money, a saw characterized for its Compactness, Strength,
and durability, ease of action, and firmness when in operation.</p>

<p>With each machine we give six Saw Blades, Wrench, Sheet of Designs and three Drill Points. The
Saw alone weighs 25 lbs.; Saw and Box together, 36 lbs.</p>

<p>Price of No. 2 Rogers' Saw, $4.00. This Saw is provided with a polished Tilting Table, heavily
nickel-plated. <b>Receiver to pay express or freight charges.</b></p></div>

Christmas number and run through the year. Much of the romance woven into the histories of
reigning royal families, much of the pageant attendant upon the girls "born in the purple," will be
described; but much more will be told of that application to study, that strict obedience to laws of
hygiene, that mastery of complex and rigid court etiquette, that severe control of personal disposition
and tastes, which underlies the culture and graciousness of queens and princesses. From these pages
our girls who are to go abroad may incidentally learn much of what they properly may or may not do
in European society. No lady is better equipped than Mrs. Sherwood for preparing papers like these.</div>

<p>Gentlemen: Although a stranger to you, and my testimonial entirely unnecessary, as it certainly is unsolicited,
yet I take great pleasure in testifying to the excellence of your "<span class="smcap">Ivory</span>" Soap and thanking you for
putting it on the market at so low a price. It has entirely supplanted the use of Castile and other fine soaps
in my household for several years past, being in no way inferior, and from fifty to seventy-five per cent. more
economical. A good test I find for the purity of soap is to try it with a brush for cleansing the teeth and the
taste of the "<span class="smcap">Ivory</span>" Soap so used is perfectly sweet and clean. Very respectfully yours, <span class="smcap">W. S. Baker</span>, M.D.</p>
